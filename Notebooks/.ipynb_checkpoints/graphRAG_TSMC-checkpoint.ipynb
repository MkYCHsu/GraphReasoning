Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001). Figure 7.16 depicts experimental results that were obtained in an inductively coupled plasma at 10 mTorr. The HBr to oxygen ratio was\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: entire flow is typically grouped into front end of line (FEOL), mid end of line (MEOL), and back end of line (BEOL) modules. Typically, transistors are created in the FEOL module, the contacts and memory devices are formed in the MEOL, and the metallization is realized in the BEOL module. This classification varies between IC manufacturers.  The classification by IC manufacturing module is important to prevent metal cross-contamination.  In the following, we will discuss important etching applications with unique requirements.  ## 7.3.1 Patterning 7.3.1.1 Self-Aligned Patterning  The goal of most etching processes is to transfer a pattern generated by lithography to form a structure that stays in the integrated circuit. In the early days of IC manufacturing, lithography created the pattern and RIE transferred it into silicon, silicon oxide, or aluminum to form transistor gates, isolation features, and metal lines to conduct the current. At that time, special \"patterning etches\" did not exist.  Device shrinking leads to higher aspect ratios and the need for better CD control.  This trend started with silicon etches because silicon RIE requires oxygen addition to the chlorine- and bromine-based etching chemistry and resists did not provide sufficient selectivity. This necessitated the introduction of hardmasks for etching of  ![184_image_0.png](184_image_0.png)  silicon gates and silicon isolation trenches and introduced a new class of applications, mask open or hardmask patterning, at the 180 nm node. Later, carbon layers were introduced to open thick dielectric hardmasks and to etch dielectric features.  Because carbon cannot be etched selectively with resist, this required a thin dielectric layer on top of the carbon, which also acted as a DARC for lithography. Because DARC layers contained nitrogen, which interacts with the resist to form a foot at the bottom of the profile, organic antireflective coating where introduced. These films were also called BARC. As a\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: The study shows that the LWR is degraded at the top of the resist pattern and propagates along the pattern sidewalls. The high- and medium-frequency components of the roughness are not completely transferred during the gate patterning, allowing an LWR decrease at each plasma step. An overview on resist mask durability during plasma etching can be found in a review paper by Oehrlein et al. (2011).  RIE cannot improve low-frequency LER and LWR because the dimensions are too large to be removed by etching or deposition. However, RIE can cause resist and hardmask bending or toppling which worsens low frequency LER and LWR. The effect of line bending and toppling is a function of the aspect ratio of the line, as well as the stress and Young's modulus of the material. It is also called line buckling or wiggling. Stan et al. compared experimental and modeling results for thin lines made of a low-k dielectric (interlayer dielectric, ILD) and etched with a TiN hardmask (Stan et al. 2015). Such structures are used in patterning of trenches for copper metallization in the back end of line (BEOL) module of logic and memory devices.  The etched structures were measured by means of AFM. The etching depth was found to be one of the main control parameters for buckling. For the same width, buckling is more pronounced for the lines that are patterned deeper and have larger aspect ratios. The height of the TiN mask and the Young's modulus of the ILD, and the Young's modulus and compressive stress of the TiN mask are other parameters influencing buckling behavior. Line bending is induced by the compressive stress in the TiN mask and the work of the compressive forces is converted into bending energies of the structure. The stress of the ILD fin was 2 orders of magnitude lower than for TiN in the experiment and could be ignored. The line bending mechanism is illustrated in Figure 7.29.  Figure 7.30 shows the contour lines that separate the buckled and unbuckled states for the\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: of sputtered products is increased. Here, redeposition was modeled by increasing the sticking coefficient (Berry et al. 2018), while in practical applications, this is frequently accomplished by increasing the ion flux or ion energy to enhance sputtering.  Tuning of the ion energy by changing the RF bias power is a profile tuning knob, which is commonly used in RIE process development. It is based on sidewall passivation direct line-of-sight redeposition of nonvolatile etching products. The flux of the passivation species to the sidewall depends among others on the surface area of the etching front. A narrow feature will see a lower flux of passivating species compared to a feature with large adjacent open areas such as an isolated line or a line at the end of an array. This leads to more tapered isolated features. The effect is called profile microloading and can be observed for plasma passivation and line-of-sight passivation. It is an undesired effect because it introduces differences in the taper angle and the CD of the features.  Besides synergistic etching as expressed by Eq. (7.4), RIE mechanisms can include simultaneous thermal and radical etching as well as direct physical and chemical sputtering. Sidewall passivation must prevent lateral etching by radicals and reactive neutrals as well as from ion bombardment. Etching of aluminum in a chlorine plasma is a good example for protection from radical etching. AlCl3 has a boiling point of 180 ∘C, and hence RIE of aluminum in chlorine plasmas has a large radical etching component. Boron- and carbon-containing gases are used to passivate the sidewall while the bottom of the feature is kept clean of passivating species by ion bombardment.  The role of sidewall passivation in high aspect ratio SiO2 etching is the prevention of etching from synergistic etching and also direct physical and chemical sputtering. The ion energies in this process are so high that non-synergistic sputtering plays an important role (see\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: structures are comprised of several layers, it is important to identify the roughening or smoothening effects for each step. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques have been developed to measure the roughness of sidewalls directly on photomasks (Reynolds et al. 1999) and etched features on the wafer (Goldfarb et al. 2004).  ![179_image_0.png](179_image_0.png)  microloading/LWR trade-off can be overcome by separating photoresist etching and deposition reactions. Source: Lill et al. (2014). Goldfarb et al. demonstrated that isotropic resist roughness found on the resist walls after the lithographic step becomes anisotropic during the etching of dielectric underlayer with fluorine-based plasmas. These anisotropic resist roughness features are called striations. Striations that are generated on the resist layer act as templates for the propagation of such topography into the etched underlayers (Goldfarb et al.  2004). Roughness propagation is reduced in case of more remaining resist, either by starting with taller resist or by increasing selectivity. The general trend in the industry, however, is toward thinner and less etch-resistant photoresists. This places a high value on highly selective mask open etch processes.  A typical gate stack contains the following films from the top: photoresist/bottom antireflective coating (BARC)/SiO2 hardmask/polysilicon. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements revealed that the LWR after the SiO2 or carbon hardmask open step was transferred into the polysilicon gate during the gate etching step with HBr/Cl2/O2 (Pargon et al. 2008). This implies that the control of the final polysilicon LWR/LER strongly depends on the lithography and plasma etching steps preceding the gate etching step and that these steps must be optimized to succeed in minimizing the final polysilicon gate LWR/LER.  A proven approach to reduced roughening of the photoresist includes plasma treatment steps (Pargon et al. 2009; Azarnouche et al. 2013). Pargon et\n",

Here, redeposition was modeled by increasing the sticking coefficient (Berry et al. 2018), while in practical applications, this is frequently accomplished by increasing the ion flux or ion energy to enhance sputtering.  Tuning of the ion energy by changing the RF bias power is a profile tuning knob, which is commonly used in RIE process development. It is based on sidewall passivation direct line-of-sight redeposition of nonvolatile etching products. The flux of the passivation species to the sidewall depends among others on the surface area of the etching front. A narrow feature will see a lower flux of passivating species compared to a feature with large adjacent open areas such as an isolated line or a line at the end of an array. This leads to more tapered isolated features. The effect is called profile microloading and can be observed for plasma passivation and line-of-sight passivation. It is an undesired effect because it introduces differences in the taper angle and the CD of the features.  Besides synergistic etching as expressed by Eq. (7.4), RIE mechanisms can include simultaneous thermal and radical etching as well as direct physical and chemical sputtering. Sidewall passivation must prevent lateral etching by radicals and reactive neutrals as well as from ion bombardment. Etching of aluminum in a chlorine plasma is a good example for protection from radical etching. AlCl3 has a boiling point of 180 ∘C, and hence RIE of aluminum in chlorine plasmas has a large radical etching component. Boron- and carbon-containing gases are used to passivate the sidewall while the bottom of the feature is kept clean of passivating species by ion bombardment.  The role of sidewall passivation in high aspect ratio SiO2 etching is the prevention of etching from synergistic etching and also direct physical and chemical sputtering. The ion energies in this process are so high that non-synergistic sputtering plays an important role (see\n",

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001). Figure 7.16 depicts experimental results that were obtained in an inductively coupled plasma at 10 mTorr. The HBr to oxygen ratio was\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: The study shows that the LWR is degraded at the top of the resist pattern and propagates along the pattern sidewalls. The high- and medium-frequency components of the roughness are not completely transferred during the gate patterning, allowing an LWR decrease at each plasma step. An overview on resist mask durability during plasma etching can be found in a review paper by Oehrlein et al. (2011).  RIE cannot improve low-frequency LER and LWR because the dimensions are too large to be removed by etching or deposition. However, RIE can cause resist and hardmask bending or toppling which worsens low frequency LER and LWR. The effect of line bending and toppling is a function of the aspect ratio of the line, as well as the stress and Young's modulus of the material. It is also called line buckling or wiggling. Stan et al. compared experimental and modeling results for thin lines made of a low-k dielectric (interlayer dielectric, ILD) and etched with a TiN hardmask (Stan et al. 2015). Such structures are used in patterning of trenches for copper metallization in the back end of line (BEOL) module of logic and memory devices.  The etched structures were measured by means of AFM. The etching depth was found to be one of the main control parameters for buckling. For the same width, buckling is more pronounced for the lines that are patterned deeper and have larger aspect ratios. The height of the TiN mask and the Young's modulus of the ILD, and the Young's modulus and compressive stress of the TiN mask are other parameters influencing buckling behavior. Line bending is induced by the compressive stress in the TiN mask and the work of the compressive forces is converted into bending energies of the structure. The stress of the ILD fin was 2 orders of magnitude lower than for TiN in the experiment and could be ignored. The line bending mechanism is illustrated in Figure 7.29.  Figure 7.30 shows the contour lines that separate the buckled and unbuckled states for the\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: 1999). Schaepkens et al. proposed a mathematical description of the etching yields, which includes the fluorocarbon deposition rate, net fluorocarbon etch rate, and a carbon consumption factor.  The thickness dependence of RIE with fluorocarbon feed gases in Figure 7.12 is different from what we observed for directional ALE with polymer film activation (see Figure 6.15, Metzler et al. 2014). In RIE, the source of reactive fluorine and carbon species is the continuous flux of these species. The process is limited by the ion-assisted diffusion of the reactants to and the reaction products from the selvedge layer. If this layer is too thick, etching will cease. In ALE, etch per cycle (EPC) is limited by the amount of carbon and fluorine in the polymer layer. If the layer is thicker than the projected range of the incoming ions, i.e. if these ions cannot reach the selvedge layer to stimulate reactions with the etching surface, it will be sputtered until it reaches the critical thickness. This will increase the step time to reach saturation but not the EPC.  ## 7.2.2 Ernu  The complexity of the RIE etching mechanism creates severe engineering challenges to achieve etching rate uniformities that meet the requirements of advanced semiconductor devices. ALE etching technologies leverage self-saturation of the steps to achieve EPC uniformity across the wafer. Thermal and radical etching use in most implementations just one flux of reactive species, and control of the flux uniformity and surface temperature are sufficient.  RIE, however, is characterized by continuous ion and neutral fluxes, which act synergistically according to Eq. (7.4). Thermal etching as well as physical and chemical sputtering can also contribute to the local etching rate non-uniformity (ERNU). Passivating species are deposited onto the surface. In addition, dissociation and redeposition of reaction products contribute to local etching rates. These processes are affected by complicated neutral\n",

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques have been developed to measure the roughness of sidewalls directly on photomasks (Reynolds et al. 1999) and etched features on the wafer (Goldfarb et al. 2004).  ![179_image_0.png](179_image_0.png)  microloading/LWR trade-off can be overcome by separating photoresist etching and deposition reactions. Source: Lill et al. (2014). Goldfarb et al. demonstrated that isotropic resist roughness found on the resist walls after the lithographic step becomes anisotropic during the etching of dielectric underlayer with fluorine-based plasmas. These anisotropic resist roughness features are called striations. Striations that are generated on the resist layer act as templates for the propagation of such topography into the etched underlayers (Goldfarb et al.  2004). Roughness propagation is reduced in case of more remaining resist, either by starting with taller resist or by increasing selectivity. The general trend in the industry, however, is toward thinner and less etch-resistant photoresists. This places a high value on highly selective mask open etch processes.  A typical gate stack contains the following films from the top: photoresist/bottom antireflective coating (BARC)/SiO2 hardmask/polysilicon. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements revealed that the LWR after the SiO2 or carbon hardmask open step was transferred into the polysilicon gate during the gate etching step with HBr/Cl2/O2 (Pargon et al. 2008). This implies that the control of the final polysilicon LWR/LER strongly depends on the lithography and plasma etching steps preceding the gate etching step and that these steps must be optimized to succeed in minimizing the final polysilicon gate LWR/LER.  A proven approach to reduced roughening of the photoresist includes plasma treatment steps (Pargon et al. 2009; Azarnouche et al. 2013). Pargon et\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: of the etching product (Oehrlein and Lee 1987).  Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: photolithography scanners using 193 nm wavelength lasers and numerical apertures of 1.35 have fundamental printing limits of 40–45 nm half-pitch. To form equal width lines and spaces, the ratio of the mandrel to space width must be around 1 : 3. Lithography prints 45 nm equal lines and spaces. Subsequently, the line is trimmed in an oxygen-based plasma to about 23 nm, which increases the space to 67 nm. This trim process also has the benefit that highand medium-frequency LER/LWR is reduced.  The mask to etch mandrel is a dielectric layer, in most cases DARC, which is a silicon oxynitride (SiON). If the mandrel is carbon, the selectivity is intrinsic. A deposition process is not needed to obtain selectivity. Oxygen etches carbon spontaneously and sidewall passivation is obtained by adding HBr- or sulfur-containing compounds such as COS or SO2 to the oxygen plasma. The passivating effect of bromine is based on the fact that CBr4 is not very volatile - it has a boiling point of 190 ∘C. Bromine can also combine with the silicon, which is sputtered from the hardmask, and oxygen to form silicon oxybromides. The passivating effect of sulfur is thought to be caused by the ability of sulfur to form polymers with carbon. The passivation is deposited from the plasma.  In the case of a polysilicon mandrel, typical RIE processes are halogen based. If chlorine or hydrogen bromide gases are used, selectivity to the mask is achieved via plasma deposition of silicon oxychloride and oxybromide reaction products. These compounds also deliver sidewall passivation. For fluorine-based plasma chemistry, fluorocarbon polymer gases are added to provide mask and sidewall passivation by carbon compounds.  The mandrel profiles must be absolutely vertical and without bottom foot. Otherwise, the spacer profiled will be asymmetric and in extreme cases the spacer can topple. Thin yet effective passivation layers such as sulfur or carbon are preferred.  The next step in the SADP flow is spacer\n",

Here, redeposition was modeled by increasing the sticking coefficient (Berry et al. 2018), while in practical applications, this is frequently accomplished by increasing the ion flux or ion energy to enhance sputtering.  Tuning of the ion energy by changing the RF bias power is a profile tuning knob, which is commonly used in RIE process development. It is based on sidewall passivation direct line-of-sight redeposition of nonvolatile etching products. The flux of the passivation species to the sidewall depends among others on the surface area of the etching front. A narrow feature will see a lower flux of passivating species compared to a feature with large adjacent open areas such as an isolated line or a line at the end of an array. This leads to more tapered isolated features. The effect is called profile microloading and can be observed for plasma passivation and line-of-sight passivation. It is an undesired effect because it introduces differences in the taper angle and the CD of the features.  Besides synergistic etching as expressed by Eq. (7.4), RIE mechanisms can include simultaneous thermal and radical etching as well as direct physical and chemical sputtering. Sidewall passivation must prevent lateral etching by radicals and reactive neutrals as well as from ion bombardment. Etching of aluminum in a chlorine plasma is a good example for protection from radical etching. AlCl3 has a boiling point of 180 ∘C, and hence RIE of aluminum in chlorine plasmas has a large radical etching component. Boron- and carbon-containing gases are used to passivate the sidewall while the bottom of the feature is kept clean of passivating species by ion bombardment.  The role of sidewall passivation in high aspect ratio SiO2 etching is the prevention of etching from synergistic etching and also direct physical and chemical sputtering.

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: The study shows that the LWR is degraded at the top of the resist pattern and propagates along the pattern sidewalls. The high- and medium-frequency components of the roughness are not completely transferred during the gate patterning, allowing an LWR decrease at each plasma step. An overview on resist mask durability during plasma etching can be found in a review paper by Oehrlein et al. (2011).  RIE cannot improve low-frequency LER and LWR because the dimensions are too large to be removed by etching or deposition. However, RIE can cause resist and hardmask bending or toppling which worsens low frequency LER and LWR. The effect of line bending and toppling is a function of the aspect ratio of the line, as well as the stress and Young's modulus of the material. It is also called line buckling or wiggling. Stan et al. compared experimental and modeling results for thin lines made of a low-k dielectric (interlayer dielectric, ILD) and etched with a TiN hardmask (Stan et al. 2015). Such structures are used in patterning of trenches for copper metallization in the back end of line (BEOL) module of logic and memory devices.  The etched structures were measured by means of AFM. The etching depth was found to be one of the main control parameters for buckling. For the same width, buckling is more pronounced for the lines that are patterned deeper and have larger aspect ratios. The height of the TiN mask and the Young's modulus of the ILD, and the Young's modulus and compressive stress of the TiN mask are other parameters influencing buckling behavior. Line bending is induced by the compressive stress in the TiN mask and the work of the compressive forces is converted into bending energies of the structure. The stress of the ILD fin was 2 orders of magnitude lower than for TiN in the experiment and could be ignored. The line bending mechanism is illustrated in Figure 7.29.

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: structures are comprised of several layers, it is important to identify the roughening or smoothening effects for each step. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques have been developed to measure the roughness of sidewalls directly on photomasks (Reynolds et al. 1999) and etched features on the wafer (Goldfarb et al. 2004).  ![179_image_0.png](179_image_0.png)  microloading/LWR trade-off can be overcome by separating photoresist etching and deposition reactions. Source: Lill et al. (2014). Goldfarb et al. demonstrated that isotropic resist roughness found on the resist walls after the lithographic step becomes anisotropic during the etching of dielectric underlayer with fluorine-based plasmas. These anisotropic resist roughness features are called striations. Striations that are generated on the resist layer act as templates for the propagation of such topography into the etched underlayers (Goldfarb et al.  2004). Roughness propagation is reduced in case of more remaining resist, either by starting with taller resist or by increasing selectivity. The general trend in the industry, however, is toward thinner and less etch-resistant photoresists. This places a high value on highly selective mask open etch processes.  A typical gate stack contains the following films from the top: photoresist/bottom antireflective coating (BARC)/SiO2 hardmask/polysilicon. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements revealed that the LWR after the SiO2 or carbon hardmask open step was transferred into the polysilicon gate during the gate etching step with HBr/Cl2/O2 (Pargon et al. 2008). This implies that the control of the final polysilicon LWR/LER strongly depends on the lithography and plasma etching steps preceding the gate etching step and that these steps must be optimized to succeed in minimizing the final polysilicon gate LWR/LER.  A proven approach to reduced roughening of the photoresist includes plasma treatment steps (Pargon et al. 2009; Azarnouche et al. 2013). Pargon et\n",

However, RIE can cause resist and hardmask bending or toppling which worsens low frequency LER and LWR. The effect of line bending and toppling is a function of the aspect ratio of the line, as well as the stress and Young's modulus of the material. It is also called line buckling or wiggling. Stan et al. compared experimental and modeling results for thin lines made of a low-k dielectric (interlayer dielectric, ILD) and etched with a TiN hardmask (Stan et al. 2015). Such structures are used in patterning of trenches for copper metallization in the back end of line (BEOL) module of logic and memory devices.  The etched structures were measured by means of AFM. The etching depth was found to be one of the main control parameters for buckling. For the same width, buckling is more pronounced for the lines that are patterned deeper and have larger aspect ratios. The height of the TiN mask and the Young's modulus of the ILD, and the Young's modulus and compressive stress of the TiN mask are other parameters influencing buckling behavior. Line bending is induced by the compressive stress in the TiN mask and the work of the compressive forces is converted into bending energies of the structure. The stress of the ILD fin was 2 orders of magnitude lower than for TiN in the experiment and could be ignored. The line bending mechanism is illustrated in Figure 7.29.

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: DARC layers contained nitrogen, which interacts with the resist to form a foot at the bottom of the profile, organic antireflective coating where introduced. These films were also called BARC. As a result, simple hardmasks evolved into complex stacks designed to address lithography and etching challenges.  In most cases, these multiple mask layers are etched in situ in the same RIE chamber. This triggered the introduction of complex, multilayer hardmask or patterning etches. The number of etching applications that were needed to generate the final mask increased steadily from there as shown in Figure 7.31. At the 45 nm node, cut masks were introduced to reduce the tip-to-tip space between lines. Direct lithography and etching would create too large a gap between the line ends due to optical and etch proximity effects. In the cut mask approach, the top DARC layer is patterned first as lines and spaces. Then, the resist is stripped, and a new resist layer is spun on. Lithography then prints just small windows, which allow cutting the lines via RIE. Subsequently, the rest of the mask step is etched. Cut masks utilize the idea to divide the pattern into two or more parts and to process each conventionally.  The complete pattern then emerges when all lithography and etching processes are completed. This is a brute force method to generate features beyond the resolution of lithography and is called Litho-etch-Litho-etch (LELE). It is obviously expensive and also suffers from the challenge to align the different parts of the overall pattern precisely. This alignment is called overlay. Overlay errors contribute to EPE just line CD bias, CD microloading, LWR, and LER.  In this section, we will discuss self-aligned double and quadruple patterning, which increases the number of etch applications further as shown in Figure 7.32.  ![185_image_0.png](185_image_0.png)  At the core of self-aligned multi-patterning is the sidewall image transfer (SIT) or spacer patterning\n",

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

This classification varies between IC manufacturers.  The classification by IC manufacturing module is important to prevent metal cross-contamination.  In the following, we will discuss important etching applications with unique requirements.  ## 7.3.1 Patterning 7.3.1.1 Self-Aligned Patterning  The goal of most etching processes is to transfer a pattern generated by lithography to form a structure that stays in the integrated circuit. In the early days of IC manufacturing, lithography created the pattern and RIE transferred it into silicon, silicon oxide, or aluminum to form transistor gates, isolation features, and metal lines to conduct the current. At that time, special \"patterning etches\" did not exist.  Device shrinking leads to higher aspect ratios and the need for better CD control.  This trend started with silicon etches because silicon RIE requires oxygen addition to the chlorine- and bromine-based etching chemistry and resists did not provide sufficient selectivity. This necessitated the introduction of hardmasks for etching of  ![184_image_0.png](184_image_0.png)  silicon gates and silicon isolation trenches and introduced a new class of applications, mask open or hardmask patterning, at the 180 nm node. Later, carbon layers were introduced to open thick dielectric hardmasks and to etch dielectric features.

Here, redeposition was modeled by increasing the sticking coefficient (Berry et al. 2018), while in practical applications, this is frequently accomplished by increasing the ion flux or ion energy to enhance sputtering.  Tuning of the ion energy by changing the RF bias power is a profile tuning knob, which is commonly used in RIE process development. It is based on sidewall passivation direct line-of-sight redeposition of nonvolatile etching products. The flux of the passivation species to the sidewall depends among others on the surface area of the etching front. A narrow feature will see a lower flux of passivating species compared to a feature with large adjacent open areas such as an isolated line or a line at the end of an array. This leads to more tapered isolated features. The effect is called profile microloading and can be observed for plasma passivation and line-of-sight passivation. It is an undesired effect because it introduces differences in the taper angle and the CD of the features.  Besides synergistic etching as expressed by Eq. (7.4), RIE mechanisms can include simultaneous thermal and radical etching as well as direct physical and chemical sputtering. Sidewall passivation must prevent lateral etching by radicals and reactive neutrals as well as from ion bombardment. Etching of aluminum in a chlorine plasma is a good example for protection from radical etching. AlCl3 has a boiling point of 180 ∘C, and hence RIE of aluminum in chlorine plasmas has a large radical etching component. Boron- and carbon-containing gases are used to passivate the sidewall while the bottom of the feature is kept clean of passivating species by ion bombardment.  The role of sidewall passivation in high aspect ratio SiO2 etching is the prevention of etching from synergistic etching and also direct physical and chemical sputtering.

Fluorocarbon polymer gases are added to provide mask and sidewall passivation by carbon compounds. This step is critical in preventing excessive etching of the SiO2 layer.\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: of the etching product (Oehrlein and Lee 1987).  Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001). Figure 7.16 depicts experimental results that were obtained in an inductively coupled plasma at 10 mTorr. The HBr to oxygen ratio was\n",

Here, redeposition was modeled by increasing the sticking coefficient (Berry et al. 2018), while in practical applications, this is frequently accomplished by increasing the ion flux or ion energy to enhance sputtering.  Tuning of the ion energy by changing the RF bias power is a profile tuning knob, which is commonly used in RIE process development. It is based on sidewall passivation direct line-of-sight redeposition of nonvolatile etching products. The flux of the passivation species to the sidewall depends among others on the surface area of the etching front. A narrow feature will see a lower flux of passivating species compared to a feature with large adjacent open areas such as an isolated line or a line at the end of an array. This leads to more tapered isolated features. The effect is called profile microloading and can be observed for plasma passivation and line-of-sight passivation. It is an undesired effect because it introduces differences in the taper angle and the CD of the features.  Besides synergistic etching as expressed by Eq. (7.4), RIE mechanisms can include simultaneous thermal and radical etching as well as direct physical and chemical sputtering. Sidewall passivation must prevent lateral etching by radicals and reactive neutrals as well as from ion bombardment. Etching of aluminum in a chlorine plasma is a good example for protection from radical etching. AlCl3 has a boiling point of 180 ∘C, and hence RIE of aluminum in chlorine plasmas has a large radical etching component. Boron- and carbon-containing gases are used to passivate the sidewall while the bottom of the feature is kept clean of passivating species by ion bombardment.  The role of sidewall passivation in high aspect ratio SiO2 etching is the prevention of etching from synergistic etching and also direct physical and chemical sputtering. The ion energies in this process are so high that non-synergistic sputtering plays an important role (see\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: The study shows that the LWR is degraded at the top of the resist pattern and propagates along the pattern sidewalls. The high- and medium-frequency components of the roughness are not completely transferred during the gate patterning, allowing an LWR decrease at each plasma step. An overview on resist mask durability during plasma etching can be found in a review paper by Oehrlein et al. (2011).  RIE cannot improve low-frequency LER and LWR because the dimensions are too large to be removed by etching or deposition. However, RIE can cause resist and hardmask bending or toppling which worsens low frequency LER and LWR. The effect of line bending and toppling is a function of the aspect ratio of the line, as well as the stress and Young's modulus of the material. It is also called line buckling or wiggling. Stan et al. compared experimental and modeling results for thin lines made of a low-k dielectric (interlayer dielectric, ILD) and etched with a TiN hardmask (Stan et al. 2015). Such structures are used in patterning of trenches for copper metallization in the back end of line (BEOL) module of logic and memory devices.  The etched structures were measured by means of AFM. The etching depth was found to be one of the main control parameters for buckling. For the same width, buckling is more pronounced for the lines that are patterned deeper and have larger aspect ratios. The height of the TiN mask and the Young's modulus of the ILD, and the Young's modulus and compressive stress of the TiN mask are other parameters influencing buckling behavior. Line bending is induced by the compressive stress in the TiN mask and the work of the compressive forces is converted into bending energies of the structure. The stress of the ILD fin was 2 orders of magnitude lower than for TiN in the experiment and could be ignored. The line bending mechanism is illustrated in Figure 7.29.  Figure 7.30 shows the contour lines that separate the buckled and unbuckled states for the\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: structures are comprised of several layers, it is important to identify the roughening or smoothening effects for each step. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques have been developed to measure the roughness of sidewalls directly on photomasks (Reynolds et al. 1999) and etched features on the wafer (Goldfarb et al. 2004).  ![179_image_0.png](179_image_0.png)  microloading/LWR trade-off can be overcome by separating photoresist etching and deposition reactions. Source: Lill et al. (2014). Goldfarb et al. demonstrated that isotropic resist roughness found on the resist walls after the lithographic step becomes anisotropic during the etching of dielectric underlayer with fluorine-based plasmas. These anisotropic resist roughness features are called striations. Striations that are generated on the resist layer act as templates for the propagation of such topography into the etched underlayers (Goldfarb et al.  2004). Roughness propagation is reduced in case of more remaining resist, either by starting with taller resist or by increasing selectivity. The general trend in the industry, however, is toward thinner and less etch-resistant photoresists. This places a high value on highly selective mask open etch processes.  A typical gate stack contains the following films from the top: photoresist/bottom antireflective coating (BARC)/SiO2 hardmask/polysilicon. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements revealed that the LWR after the SiO2 or carbon hardmask open step was transferred into the polysilicon gate during the gate etching step with HBr/Cl2/O2 (Pargon et al. 2008). This implies that the control of the final polysilicon LWR/LER strongly depends on the lithography and plasma etching steps preceding the gate etching step and that these steps must be optimized to succeed in minimizing the final polysilicon gate LWR/LER.  A proven approach to reduced roughening of the photoresist includes plasma treatment steps (Pargon et al. 2009; Azarnouche et al. 2013). Pargon et\n",

The ion energies in this process are so high that non-synergistic sputtering plays an important role (see Section 7.3.3). Ion impact will cause sputtering of the sidewall passivation layer, but as long as the passivation layer is replenished, the bulk material underneath is protected. An equilibrium between deposition and etching must be achieved via balancing of the species fluxes. If the passivation layer is too thick, the aspect ratio of the etching feature is increased and ARDE slows the etching rate.  This is for instance a challenge in contact etching for advanced logic devices. Directional ALE with C4F8/Ar+ is increasingly used instead of C4F8-based RIE because the polymer is removed in the Ar ion sputtering step, which prevents clogging of the feature.  ## 7.2.5.2 Selection Of Etching Species  In this approach to achieve vertical profiles, isotropic etching caused by radical or thermal etching is suppressed by selecting etching gases, which form less volatile reaction products (Coburn and Winters 1979b). Coburn gives the example of etching of silicon with fluorine-, chlorine-, and bromine-containing gases (Coburn 1994a).  Silicon etches spontaneously when exposed to fluorine radicals or neutrals such as F2 and XeF2 and hence forms re-entrant profiles. The isotropic etching component of chlorine plasmas is much less and absent for bromine. This etching behavior of silicon when exposed to different halogen plasmas can be explained by the volatility of the reaction products. The boiling points for SiF4, SiCl4, and SiBr4 are −86, 57.6, and 153 ∘C, respectively. Hence, SiF4 is much more likely to desorb at thermal energies than SiBr4, which requires ion bombardment to stimulate desorption.  Based on this observation, Coburn suggested to use mixtures of fluorine, chlorine, and bromine gases to achieve vertical profiles as schematically shown in Figure 7.21. This approach is\n",

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: The study shows that the LWR is degraded at the top of the resist pattern and propagates along the pattern sidewalls. The high- and medium-frequency components of the roughness are not completely transferred during the gate patterning, allowing an LWR decrease at each plasma step. An overview on resist mask durability during plasma etching can be found in a review paper by Oehrlein et al. (2011).  RIE cannot improve low-frequency LER and LWR because the dimensions are too large to be removed by etching or deposition. However, RIE can cause resist and hardmask bending or toppling which worsens low frequency LER and LWR. The effect of line bending and toppling is a function of the aspect ratio of the line, as well as the stress and Young's modulus of the material. It is also called line buckling or wiggling. Stan et al. compared experimental and modeling results for thin lines made of a low-k dielectric (interlayer dielectric, ILD) and etched with a TiN hardmask (Stan et al. 2015). Such structures are used in patterning of trenches for copper metallization in the back end of line (BEOL) module of logic and memory devices.  The etched structures were measured by means of AFM. The etching depth was found to be one of the main control parameters for buckling. For the same width, buckling is more pronounced for the lines that are patterned deeper and have larger aspect ratios. The height of the TiN mask and the Young's modulus of the ILD, and the Young's modulus and compressive stress of the TiN mask are other parameters influencing buckling behavior. Line bending is induced by the compressive stress in the TiN mask and the work of the compressive forces is converted into bending energies of the structure. The stress of the ILD fin was 2 orders of magnitude lower than for TiN in the experiment and could be ignored. The line bending mechanism is illustrated in Figure 7.29.  Figure 7.30 shows the contour lines that separate the buckled and unbuckled states for the\n",

Tuning of the ion energy by changing the RF bias power is a profile tuning knob, which is commonly used in RIE process development. It is based on sidewall passivation direct line-of-sight redeposition of nonvolatile etching products. The flux of the passivation species to the sidewall depends among others on the surface area of the etching front. A narrow feature will see a lower flux of passivating species compared to a feature with large adjacent open areas such as an isolated line or a line at the end of an array. This leads to more tapered isolated features. The effect is called profile microloading and can be observed for plasma passivation and line-of-sight passivation. It is an undesired effect because it introduces differences in the taper angle and the CD of the features.  Besides synergistic etching as expressed by Eq.

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: entire flow is typically grouped into front end of line (FEOL), mid end of line (MEOL), and back end of line (BEOL) modules. Typically, transistors are created in the FEOL module, the contacts and memory devices are formed in the MEOL, and the metallization is realized in the BEOL module. This classification varies between IC manufacturers.  The classification by IC manufacturing module is important to prevent metal cross-contamination.  In the following, we will discuss important etching applications with unique requirements.  ## 7.3.1 Patterning 7.3.1.1 Self-Aligned Patterning  The goal of most etching processes is to transfer a pattern generated by lithography to form a structure that stays in the integrated circuit. In the early days of IC manufacturing, lithography created the pattern and RIE transferred it into silicon, silicon oxide, or aluminum to form transistor gates, isolation features, and metal lines to conduct the current. At that time, special \"patterning etches\" did not exist.  Device shrinking leads to higher aspect ratios and the need for better CD control.  This trend started with silicon etches because silicon RIE requires oxygen addition to the chlorine- and bromine-based etching chemistry and resists did not provide sufficient selectivity. This necessitated the introduction of hardmasks for etching of  ![184_image_0.png](184_image_0.png)  silicon gates and silicon isolation trenches and introduced a new class of applications, mask open or hardmask patterning, at the 180 nm node. Later, carbon layers were introduced to open thick dielectric hardmasks and to etch dielectric features.  Because carbon cannot be etched selectively with resist, this required a thin dielectric layer on top of the carbon, which also acted as a DARC for lithography. Because DARC layers contained nitrogen, which interacts with the resist to form a foot at the bottom of the profile, organic antireflective coating where introduced. These films were also called BARC. As a\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: photolithography scanners using 193 nm wavelength lasers and numerical apertures of 1.35 have fundamental printing limits of 40–45 nm half-pitch. To form equal width lines and spaces, the ratio of the mandrel to space width must be around 1 : 3. Lithography prints 45 nm equal lines and spaces. Subsequently, the line is trimmed in an oxygen-based plasma to about 23 nm, which increases the space to 67 nm. This trim process also has the benefit that highand medium-frequency LER/LWR is reduced.  The mask to etch mandrel is a dielectric layer, in most cases DARC, which is a silicon oxynitride (SiON). If the mandrel is carbon, the selectivity is intrinsic. A deposition process is not needed to obtain selectivity. Oxygen etches carbon spontaneously and sidewall passivation is obtained by adding HBr- or sulfur-containing compounds such as COS or SO2 to the oxygen plasma. The passivating effect of bromine is based on the fact that CBr4 is not very volatile - it has a boiling point of 190 ∘C. Bromine can also combine with the silicon, which is sputtered from the hardmask, and oxygen to form silicon oxybromides. The passivating effect of sulfur is thought to be caused by the ability of sulfur to form polymers with carbon. The passivation is deposited from the plasma.  In the case of a polysilicon mandrel, typical RIE processes are halogen based. If chlorine or hydrogen bromide gases are used, selectivity to the mask is achieved via plasma deposition of silicon oxychloride and oxybromide reaction products. These compounds also deliver sidewall passivation. For fluorine-based plasma chemistry, fluorocarbon polymer gases are added to provide mask and sidewall passivation by carbon compounds.  The mandrel profiles must be absolutely vertical and without bottom foot. Otherwise, the spacer profiled will be asymmetric and in extreme cases the spacer can topple. Thin yet effective passivation layers such as sulfur or carbon are preferred.  The next step in the SADP flow is spacer\n",

Depending on the boiling point of these species, they may leave the surface at thermal energies or may require kinetic energy from an ion impact. It is a common method to compare the boiling point of the hydrates, oxides, and halogens to select the appropriate etching gas for a given element. The lower the boiling points of the compounds, the higher the etching rate. The binding energy of the unreacted bulk material is considered important for ion-driven processes such as high aspect ratio etches. Mask materials are optimized to achieve high binding energies for high selectivity. A proxy for the effective binding energy is the modulus of the material.  A special case of the influence of material properties on RIE rates is the etching of doped silicon. Heavily n-doped silicon etches faster, and p-doped silicon etches slower than undoped silicon in a fluorine plasma (Lee and Chen 1986; Winters and Haarer 1987). This doping effect is more pronounced in fluorine radical etching than in RIE. The effect is stronger in chlorine fluorine plasmas followed by fluorine and bromine as shown in Figure 7.10. The experiments in Figure 7.10 were conducted in an inductively coupled plasma reactor at a pressure of 4 mTorr, 475 W source power, and 70 W bias power.  The corresponding profiles tend to be more undercut for n-doped silicon and more tapered for p-doped silicon if the undoped silicon profile is vertical. Lee and Chen proposed a space charge model to explain the doping effect in silicon etching.  This model assumes that the etching rate is limited by a field-enhanced diffusion  ![157_image_0.png](157_image_0.png)  mechanism, i.e. Cabrera–Mott (CM) diffusion (Winters et al. 1983). Doping modifies the space charge at the surface. Field-enhanced diffusion in n-doped silicon drives the halogen ion into the bulk and enhances etching, while a repulsive field in p-doped silicon pushes the halogen ion to the surface and hence suppresses etching (Lee and Chen\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: 1999). Schaepkens et al. proposed a mathematical description of the etching yields, which includes the fluorocarbon deposition rate, net fluorocarbon etch rate, and a carbon consumption factor.  The thickness dependence of RIE with fluorocarbon feed gases in Figure 7.12 is different from what we observed for directional ALE with polymer film activation (see Figure 6.15, Metzler et al. 2014). In RIE, the source of reactive fluorine and carbon species is the continuous flux of these species. The process is limited by the ion-assisted diffusion of the reactants to and the reaction products from the selvedge layer. If this layer is too thick, etching will cease. In ALE, etch per cycle (EPC) is limited by the amount of carbon and fluorine in the polymer layer. If the layer is thicker than the projected range of the incoming ions, i.e. if these ions cannot reach the selvedge layer to stimulate reactions with the etching surface, it will be sputtered until it reaches the critical thickness. This will increase the step time to reach saturation but not the EPC.  ## 7.2.2 Ernu  The complexity of the RIE etching mechanism creates severe engineering challenges to achieve etching rate uniformities that meet the requirements of advanced semiconductor devices. ALE etching technologies leverage self-saturation of the steps to achieve EPC uniformity across the wafer. Thermal and radical etching use in most implementations just one flux of reactive species, and control of the flux uniformity and surface temperature are sufficient.  RIE, however, is characterized by continuous ion and neutral fluxes, which act synergistically according to Eq. (7.4). Thermal etching as well as physical and chemical sputtering can also contribute to the local etching rate non-uniformity (ERNU). Passivating species are deposited onto the surface. In addition, dissociation and redeposition of reaction products contribute to local etching rates. These processes are affected by complicated neutral\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: the leading company of a nascent semiconductor industry in the late 1950s (Hoerni 1962). Silicon doping, which is necessary to create semiconductor junctions in specific places, was achieved by first thermally growing a layer of silicon dioxide on the surface of a silicon wafer, and then wet etching windows in the oxide where the junctions were needed. The first (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) was reported by Kahng and Atalla at Bell Labs in 1960 (Kahng and Atalla 1960). In the MOS transistor, signal amplification is achieved by controlling the conduction of charge carriers at the interface between silicon and thermally grown silicon oxide. Local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) was introduced in the early 1970s (Appels et al. 1970).  These examples illustrate the tremendous importance of oxygen diffusion in silicon for the semiconductor industry. The DG model allowed to predict the thickness of thermally grown silicon oxide as a function of process parameters such as temperature, time, and pressure. The DG model considers fluxes of oxidizing species from the gas phase to the surface, from the surface to the oxidizing interface, and the flux of oxidants consumed by the oxidation reaction. These three fluxes must be equal to fulfill the requirement of conservation of fluxes. The following expression can be derived (Deal and Grove 1965): d2ox + Adox = B(t − t0) (2.10) Here, t0 is a shift in the time coordinate corresponding to an initial oxide layer and A and B are parameters. For short oxidation times, the oxidation time is a linear function of time:  $d_{\\mathrm{ox}}\\approx$.  $$(2.12)$$ The ratio B/A is called the linear DG parameter:  $${\\frac{B}{A}}={\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ox}}h_{G}}{k_{\\mathrm{ox}}+h_{G}}}\\left({\\frac{c_{G}}{N_{\\mathrm{ox}}}}\\right)$$  Nox )(2.12) Here, hG is the gas phase transport coefficient, kox is the oxidation rate constant, cG is the concentration of the oxidant in the gas phase, and N1 is the number of oxidant\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: The study shows that the LWR is degraded at the top of the resist pattern and propagates along the pattern sidewalls. The high- and medium-frequency components of the roughness are not completely transferred during the gate patterning, allowing an LWR decrease at each plasma step. An overview on resist mask durability during plasma etching can be found in a review paper by Oehrlein et al. (2011).  RIE cannot improve low-frequency LER and LWR because the dimensions are too large to be removed by etching or deposition. However, RIE can cause resist and hardmask bending or toppling which worsens low frequency LER and LWR. The effect of line bending and toppling is a function of the aspect ratio of the line, as well as the stress and Young's modulus of the material. It is also called line buckling or wiggling. Stan et al. compared experimental and modeling results for thin lines made of a low-k dielectric (interlayer dielectric, ILD) and etched with a TiN hardmask (Stan et al. 2015). Such structures are used in patterning of trenches for copper metallization in the back end of line (BEOL) module of logic and memory devices.  The etched structures were measured by means of AFM. The etching depth was found to be one of the main control parameters for buckling. For the same width, buckling is more pronounced for the lines that are patterned deeper and have larger aspect ratios. The height of the TiN mask and the Young's modulus of the ILD, and the Young's modulus and compressive stress of the TiN mask are other parameters influencing buckling behavior. Line bending is induced by the compressive stress in the TiN mask and the work of the compressive forces is converted into bending energies of the structure. The stress of the ILD fin was 2 orders of magnitude lower than for TiN in the experiment and could be ignored. The line bending mechanism is illustrated in Figure 7.29.  Figure 7.30 shows the contour lines that separate the buckled and unbuckled states for the\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: DARC layers contained nitrogen, which interacts with the resist to form a foot at the bottom of the profile, organic antireflective coating where introduced. These films were also called BARC. As a result, simple hardmasks evolved into complex stacks designed to address lithography and etching challenges.  In most cases, these multiple mask layers are etched in situ in the same RIE chamber. This triggered the introduction of complex, multilayer hardmask or patterning etches. The number of etching applications that were needed to generate the final mask increased steadily from there as shown in Figure 7.31. At the 45 nm node, cut masks were introduced to reduce the tip-to-tip space between lines. Direct lithography and etching would create too large a gap between the line ends due to optical and etch proximity effects. In the cut mask approach, the top DARC layer is patterned first as lines and spaces. Then, the resist is stripped, and a new resist layer is spun on. Lithography then prints just small windows, which allow cutting the lines via RIE. Subsequently, the rest of the mask step is etched. Cut masks utilize the idea to divide the pattern into two or more parts and to process each conventionally.  The complete pattern then emerges when all lithography and etching processes are completed. This is a brute force method to generate features beyond the resolution of lithography and is called Litho-etch-Litho-etch (LELE). It is obviously expensive and also suffers from the challenge to align the different parts of the overall pattern precisely. This alignment is called overlay. Overlay errors contribute to EPE just line CD bias, CD microloading, LWR, and LER.  In this section, we will discuss self-aligned double and quadruple patterning, which increases the number of etch applications further as shown in Figure 7.32.  ![185_image_0.png](185_image_0.png)  At the core of self-aligned multi-patterning is the sidewall image transfer (SIT) or spacer patterning\n",

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001). Figure 7.16 depicts experimental results that were obtained in an inductively coupled plasma at 10 mTorr. The HBr to oxygen ratio was\n",

Here, redeposition was modeled by increasing the sticking coefficient (Berry et al. 2018), while in practical applications, this is frequently accomplished by increasing the ion flux or ion energy to enhance sputtering.  Tuning of the ion energy by changing the RF bias power is a profile tuning knob, which is commonly used in RIE process development. It is based on sidewall passivation direct line-of-sight redeposition of nonvolatile etching products. The flux of the passivation species to the sidewall depends among others on the surface area of the etching front. A narrow feature will see a lower flux of passivating species compared to a feature with large adjacent open areas such as an isolated line or a line at the end of an array. This leads to more tapered isolated features. The effect is called profile microloading and can be observed for plasma passivation and line-of-sight passivation. It is an undesired effect because it introduces differences in the taper angle and the CD of the features.  Besides synergistic etching as expressed by Eq. (7.4), RIE mechanisms can include simultaneous thermal and radical etching as well as direct physical and chemical sputtering. Sidewall passivation must prevent lateral etching by radicals and reactive neutrals as well as from ion bombardment. Etching of aluminum in a chlorine plasma is a good example for protection from radical etching. AlCl3 has a boiling point of 180 ∘C, and hence RIE of aluminum in chlorine plasmas has a large radical etching component. Boron- and carbon-containing gases are used to passivate the sidewall while the bottom of the feature is kept clean of passivating species by ion bombardment.  The role of sidewall passivation in high aspect ratio SiO2 etching is the prevention of etching from synergistic etching and also direct physical and chemical sputtering. The ion energies in this process are so high that non-synergistic sputtering plays an important role (see\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: structures are comprised of several layers, it is important to identify the roughening or smoothening effects for each step. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques have been developed to measure the roughness of sidewalls directly on photomasks (Reynolds et al. 1999) and etched features on the wafer (Goldfarb et al. 2004).  ![179_image_0.png](179_image_0.png)  microloading/LWR trade-off can be overcome by separating photoresist etching and deposition reactions. Source: Lill et al. (2014). Goldfarb et al. demonstrated that isotropic resist roughness found on the resist walls after the lithographic step becomes anisotropic during the etching of dielectric underlayer with fluorine-based plasmas. These anisotropic resist roughness features are called striations. Striations that are generated on the resist layer act as templates for the propagation of such topography into the etched underlayers (Goldfarb et al.  2004). Roughness propagation is reduced in case of more remaining resist, either by starting with taller resist or by increasing selectivity. The general trend in the industry, however, is toward thinner and less etch-resistant photoresists. This places a high value on highly selective mask open etch processes.  A typical gate stack contains the following films from the top: photoresist/bottom antireflective coating (BARC)/SiO2 hardmask/polysilicon. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements revealed that the LWR after the SiO2 or carbon hardmask open step was transferred into the polysilicon gate during the gate etching step with HBr/Cl2/O2 (Pargon et al. 2008). This implies that the control of the final polysilicon LWR/LER strongly depends on the lithography and plasma etching steps preceding the gate etching step and that these steps must be optimized to succeed in minimizing the final polysilicon gate LWR/LER.  A proven approach to reduced roughening of the photoresist includes plasma treatment steps (Pargon et al. 2009; Azarnouche et al. 2013). Pargon et\n",

      "\n",
      "**Introduction**\n",
      "\n",
      "Etching is a critical process in semiconductor manufacturing that involves the removal of material from a substrate to create patterns and structures. The goal of this report is to discuss various aspects of etching processes, including etchant gas selection, sidewall protection, selectivity ratio, debris reduction, and pressure influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Etchant Gas Selection**\n",
      "\n",
      "The selection of etchant gases is crucial for achieving the desired etching results. A suitable etchant gas combination for achieving anisotropic etching in the first stage while maintaining a high selectivity ratio in the second stage could be a mixture of fluorine-, chlorine-, and bromine-containing gases [1]. For example, a combination of HBr and Cl2 gases could be employed for the first stage, while a combination of SF6 or CF4 gases could be used for the second stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sidewall Protection**\n",
      "\n",
      "Sidewall protection is essential for preventing lateral etching and maintaining vertical sidewalls. Techniques such as polymer-enhanced selectivity, soft-landing steps, and passivation processes can be employed to protect the sidewalls [2]. Additionally, optimizing etch conditions and using passivation techniques can help minimize debris formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Selectivity Ratio**\n",
      "\n",
      "Achieving a high selectivity ratio is critical for maintaining the integrity of the substrate. A combination of fluorine-based gases such as SF6 or CF4 with a high pressure may be suitable for achieving a selectivity ratio of 22:1 (poly-silicon to SiO2) in the second stage [3].\n",
      "\n",
      "**Debris Reduction**\n",
      "\n",
      "Reducing debris or sediment during the etching process is essential for maintaining the quality of the substrate. Techniques such as optimizing etch conditions, using passivation techniques, implementing profile microloading control, employing plasma treatment steps, and optimizing mask design can be employed to reduce debris formation [4].\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pressure Influence**\n",
      "\n",
      "The pressure influence on etching processes is significant, particularly in high-aspect-ratio etching. Optimizing the pressure can help minimize debris formation and maintain vertical sidewalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, etching processes are critical for semiconductor manufacturing, and various techniques can be employed to achieve the desired results. By optimizing etch conditions, using passivation techniques, implementing profile microloading control, employing plasma treatment steps, and optimizing mask design, debris formation can be minimized, and high-quality substrates can be achieved.\n",
