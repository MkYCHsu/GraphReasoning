      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: supply of fluorine across the fluorocarbon film to the interface and out-diffusion of the etching product (Oehrlein and Lee 1987).  Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Future of plasma etching for microelectronics Challenges Source text: BEOL must deliver on three key metrics, which are typically in competition with each other: yield, reliability, and minimizing the resistance and capacitance (RC) delays. For conventional Cu interconnects, a bilayer liner is deposited onto the etched feature first.  The materials and thicknesses of the liner stack are chosen to obtain an excellent Cu diffusion barrier and adhesion between Cu and the interlayer dielectric (ILD).36 Figure 10(a) shows a sketch of an etched trench into the ILD with a TaN/Co liner bilayer. TaN is typically deposited using physical vapor deposition (PVD) and inherently has a bread loaf shape near the feature opening resulting in a thinner film in those areas that have reduced line of sight to the ionized species. The Co film has high conformality since it is deposited by CVD. The bilayer liner is then followed, all in situ, by a PVD Cu seed film, which also has bread loafs near the opening.  Even with an ideal profile as sketched in Fig. 10(a), it can be challenging for tight pitch configurations to find a process window where the liner and seed films are thick enough on the feature sidewalls while still leaving enough of an opening at the top of the feature to plate through. Figure 10(b) shows a high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image of a 48 nm pitch interconnect where small voids are visible near the sidewalls. The prewet step during Cu plating is designed to first remove the native Cu oxide and will galvanically attack the underlying Co if the original Cu seed is too thin on the sidewall. These Cu voids then result in a fast Cu electromigration path and significantly reduce the interconnect lifetime. It is, therefore, paramount to optimize the plasma etching and produce a feature that is friendly for the PVD processes that follow.  The etched profile gets more complicated in Fig. 11(a), which shows a dual damascene V1/M2 profile landing on M1. The etch stop and hardmask are each depicted\n",

Materials such as Cu (copper) and low-k (dielectric constant) dielectrics, along with small linewidths and high aspect ratios for both Al (aluminum) and Cu feature, require unique cleaning solutions developed specifically for BEOL processing. Depending on the device type (logic, memory, etc.), the types of material (Al or Cu, low-k), the BEOL interconnect scheme, and the number of interconnect layers, there could be as many as 50 BEOL cleaning steps.  ## 4.3.1 Aluminum Interconnect Cleaning  The Al metallization process involves either the subtractive etching of metal to form the metal interconnect lines or etching vias through silica to a previous metal layer. Each etching process generates a different type of PER. After etching the Al metal interconnect, cleaning typically consists of an in situ downstream O2 or H2/O2based plasma step for resist removal, followed by wet chemistry. Although the plasma may remove most, if not all, organic species, a Cl-containing residual film often remains on the sidewall surface.  The addition of a small amount of CF4 to the O2 or H2/O2 plasma can help fluorinate the embedded metallic contamination, rendering the metal complexes more soluble in the subsequent wet cleaning chemistries and DIW rinse. Residual Cl species are a concern because of possible subsequent metal corrosion if they are not removed. Chapter 7 covers plasma stripping and cleaning processes.  Wet cleaning chemical manufacturers are under constant challenges to develop more effective chemical formulations. In the early days of the semiconductor industry it was possible to use phenolic and/or hydrocarbon-based strippers to remove the photoresist [6,7], but in many cases the PER required high bath temperatures (>120C) to remove the residue. As the technologies evolved, newer solvent systems based on N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) or other polar solvents were developed. The\n",

Adding megasonic cleaning before brush scrubbing for removing small particles and reducing brush particle loading (significant particle contamination within the brush material) improves the overall particle performance [27]. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), as a result of its SiO2 etching capability, is used to reduce metallic contaminants, by stripping a thin, metal-contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Ideally, HF cleaning is performed after the particle removal with alkaline chemistry in the brush scrubbing step [28]. However, because of brush particle loading in the HF process and the relatively long DIW rinse time required after HF etching processing, HF cleaning is usually conducted before alkaline chemistry brush scrubbing. For advanced nodes, to achieve reduction of Si3N4 loss and minimization of feature topography, slurries with high removal rate selectivity (SiO2 vs. Si3N4) are needed. Therefore, slurries containing CeO2 particles are the preferred oxide CMP slurries [5]. Neither brush scrubbing nor megasonic cleaning with dilute NH4OH or SC-1 can effectively remove CeO2 particles.  HF cleaning in a brush box provides limited capability with respect to removing CeO2 particles, which is achieved by stripping a thin CeO2contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Wafer buffing with water or chemical on a polisher platen or a separate platen is required for more effective CeO2 particle removal.  For high-k metal gate fabrication, the dummy gate-open CMP step includes polishing the SiO2 film with highly selective slurries to stop on the Si3N4 surface [28]. This is followed by polishing of the oxide, nitride, and polySi films with a nonselective slurry to stop on polySi. For this process, the postCMP cleaning step must remove particles and residues from the\n",

The removal of bulk photoresist patterns is typically accomplished by reaction with atomic oxygen (O), which is created in the plasma environment by dissociation of molecular O2 [221,222]. Basically, two types of plasma reactors can be used to conduct the process both designed for single-wafer processing.  1. A design based on remote or downstream plasma generation 2. A design based on the combination of remote with RF, microwave, or ECR sources for downstream plasma generation with RF-assisted bias.  The preferred method of bulk photoresist stripping after plasma pattern etching or ion implantation now uses downstream reactors, which minimizes ion-induced surface damage while providing good control over reaction parameters with O2 [223]. The stripping rate can often be increased by adding specific gases or vapors to the O2 plasma such as F-containing gases [224], or H2O vapor, which provides additional benefits [225]. Device structures, which cannot withstand oxidation require a nonoxidizing environment. A mixture of typically 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 can then be used as the reactive gas in the plasma cleaning procedure [201].  Patterned photoresist is often used as a mask for the selective implantation of ions. During this process, the surface of the photoresist becomes hardened, making it difficult to remove the used resist layer. Low-energy treatment in an O2 plasma containing an optimally controlled quantity of H2O vapor can remove the resist without damage to the substrate [226].  ## 1.4.6.3.3 Removal Of Etch Residues  Plasma etching used for generating higheaspect ratio Si trenches requires the formation of an etching-resistant sidewall passivation layer to provide protection from lateral etching [227].

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Future of plasma etching for microelectronics Challenges Source text: intermediate layer. Desorption of etching reaction products is thought to occur through the SiOF and fluorocarbon layers. However, as the oxygen content becomes higher, the thickness of the fluorocarbon film decreases and the etch rate increases as the SiOF layer on SiO2 becomes thicker due to ion impact.  Therefore, the etch rate strongly depends on the thicknesses of both the fluorocarbon and SiOF layers (between Regions I and II). As the oxygen content further increases, direct reaction between the ions and the SiOF layer occurs and the thickness of this layer decreases, causing the etch rate to saturate in Region II. These results quantitatively reveal that the etching properties of SiO2 are strongly related to the presence of SiOF as an intermediate layer.  This provides valuable information for predicting the etching properties of SiO2 and other materials and for further development of HAR etching methods.  Atomic layer etching has attracted attention as a method for forming precise 3D micropatterned structures, and many in situ measurement techniques have already been used to analyze surface reactions. In particular, layer-by-layer etching of 2D thin-film materials, such as graphene, MoS2, and WS2, without damage to the underlying material is becoming increasingly important. Recently, a method has been reported that enables in situ FIG. 35.

      "QUESTION: What are the optimal process parameters (e.g., temperature, ion energy distribution, plasma density) for each stage to minimize damage and ensure desired material removal?\n",
      "\n",
      "ANSWER: To determine the optimal process parameters for each stage of the etching process, we need to consider the specific requirements of each stage. For the first stage HAR etch, a high aspect ratio is required, which means that the etching process needs to be highly anisotropic. This can be achieved by using a directional etching process such as atomic layer etching (ALE) or reactive ion etching (RIE).\n",
      "\n",
      "For ALE, the optimal process parameters would include a low temperature (around 20-50°C) to minimize damage and ensure precise control over the etching process [1]. The ion energy distribution should be carefully controlled to achieve a high selectivity ratio between poly-silicon and SiO2. This can be achieved by using a high-frequency RF power source, which can narrow the ion energy distribution (IED) and increase plasma density [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "For RIE, the optimal process parameters would include a higher temperature (around 100-200°C) to increase the etch rate and achieve a high aspect ratio [3]. However, this may also increase the risk of damage to the substrate. To minimize damage, a low ion energy distribution should be used, which can be achieved by using a lower RF power source.\n",

      "In terms of plasma density, a higher plasma density is generally required for ALE to achieve a high etch rate and selectivity ratio [4]. However, this may also increase the risk of damage to the substrate. To minimize damage, a lower plasma density should be used, which can be achieved by using a lower RF power source.\n",

Another widely studied liner candidate is ruthenium (Ru) [170]. When Cu and Ru are in electrical contact in the cleaning solution, it is the Cu that is corroded [171]. Wet cleaning formulation manufactures have put considerable effort into developing cleaning solutions to overcome this issue. In addition to these new liner materials, CVD TiN has been considered as a candidate to replace the PVD TaN barrier layer for the metal 1 contact layer. The challenge, in this case, is to have a cleaning solution that removes the PVD TiN mask (about 300 A˚ ) and still is compatible with CVD TiN barrier.  Reducing the etch stop layer thickness is necessary to realize a lower capacitance for BEOL dual Damascene dielectric layers [172]. Compared with conventional SiCN etch stop layers, AlN (aluminum nitride), AlxOy (aluminum oxide), and other Al compounds are attractive because they exhibit a low etching rate with fluorine-containing gas plasma chemistry because of the predominant formation of AlF3, a low-volatility by-product [173,174]. Some IC manufacturers have replaced SiCN with AlN or AlxOy to improve etch selectivity between the low-k and etch-stop layer. There is a problem when using AlN or AlxOy for etch-stop layers in patterned wafers. During low-k etching, the AlN/AlxOy becomes damaged by exposure to fluorine-containing gas plasma and forms AlF3, which is nonvolatile, but water soluble. This poses a serious formulation challenge for wet cleaning manufacturers, because the AlN is removed when it is dissolved in DIW during the\n",

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.

A selection of representative early papers published from 1987 to 1992 on effects of contaminants are included in Refs. [21e40].  More recent representative papers on the effects of contaminants on Si and dielectrics include carbon contamination on device performance [41]; organics on electrical degradation [42]; iron (Fe) on surface roughening [43,44]; electrical effects of cobalt (Co) and Cu [45]; Cu on thin oxide breakdown [46], on gate dielectrics [47,48], in bulk Si [49]; and ionic contaminants on thermal oxidation of Si [50]. Two excellent surveys on the effects of numerous metal contaminants were presented in Refs. [51,52].  Molecular contaminant films on wafer surfaces can act as a mask and thereby prevent effective cleaning or rinsing, impair good adhesion of deposited films, and on heating form deleterious decomposition products. For example, organic residues, if exposed to high temperatures in a nonoxidizing atmosphere, can carbonize and form silicon carbide (SiC) that can nucleate polySi regions in an epitaxial layer.  Ionic contaminants cause a host of problems in Si devices. During hightemperature processing or on application of an electrical field, they may diffuse into the bulk of the semiconductor structure or spread on the surface, leading to electrical defects, device degradation, and yield losses. For example, highly mobile alkali ions in Si and amorphous SiO2 films on Si may cause drift currents and unstable surface potential, cause shifts in threshold and flat-band voltages, lead to surface current leakage, and lower the oxide breakdown field of thermally grown or deposited films of SiO2. In the growth of epitaxial Si layers, sufficiently high concentrations of ions can give rise to twinning dislocations, stacking faults, and other crystal defects.

If the metal surface is not well passivated, corrosion may also occur during wafer transfer from one polishing platen to another and during wafer transfer to the cleaning module and during post-CMP cleaning, especially when the oxidizer is not thoroughly rinsed from the metal surface. Chemical corrosion may be observed as gross corrosion, missing metal defects, voids, pits, dendrite growth, grain boundary decoration, or surface roughening. To prevent corrosion, slurry and cleaning solution composition optimization, platen-to-platen polishing time balance, postpolishing wafer rinse improvement, and wafer transfer or air-exposure time reduction are required.  Galvanic corrosion occurs when two dissimilar metals with different electrochemical potentials come in contact with each other within a film stack, such as Cu interconnect, seed, liner, and barrier materials, or if the metals are in different locations, they are connected through electrolyte solutions. In a film stack, because of galvanic corrosion, sidewall divot or fan shape recess defects may be observed. Fig. 5.2-18 shows a schematic of a Co slit divot defect caused by Co/Cu galvanic corrosion. As a result of the thin Co layer, in this case 2- to 5-nm EDX elemental mapping of film stack cross section can be used to determine the depth of the slit divot. It should be noted for sub-10-mm nodes that Co is proposed to be used as a Cu barrier and seed enhancement  ![289_image_0.png](289_image_0.png)  layer. Because of the large difference in the standard reduction potentials between Co and Cu (Cu2þ/Cu, 0.10 V vs. Co2þ/Co, -0.28 V), galvanic corrosion may occur when Co is in contact with the Cu during polishing and post-CMP cleaning.

Plasma stripping and cleaning. Reactions involved in the removal of bulk photoresist with plasma-generated atomic O were described [221,222], including the use of downstream reactors to minimize ion-induced surface damage [223]. Water vapor addition can be beneficial [225,226] and so is the use of 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 in creating a nonoxidizing environment [201].  The removal of complex etching residues from deep Si trenches [227] using reactive chemical species in a downstream microwave discharge was reported [228]. Metal etch residues with corrosive Cl impurities [222] require the use of in situ H2O-based downstream plasmas followed by wet-chemical cleaning [229]. Removal of etch residues by plasma treatments has been the subject of intensive studies to formulate effective processes. Predeposition cleaning and surface conditioning before gate dielectric formation under optimal conditions and plasma-assisted cleaning before epitaxy are additional critical operations that require carefully optimized procedures [231].

Bromine can also combine with the silicon, which is sputtered from the hardmask, and oxygen to form silicon oxybromides. The passivating effect of sulfur is thought to be caused by the ability of sulfur to form polymers with carbon. The passivation is deposited from the plasma.  In the case of a polysilicon mandrel, typical RIE processes are halogen based. If chlorine or hydrogen bromide gases are used, selectivity to the mask is achieved via plasma deposition of silicon oxychloride and oxybromide reaction products. These compounds also deliver sidewall passivation. For fluorine-based plasma chemistry, fluorocarbon polymer gases are added to provide mask and sidewall passivation by carbon compounds.  The mandrel profiles must be absolutely vertical and without bottom foot. Otherwise, the spacer profiled will be asymmetric and in extreme cases the spacer can topple. Thin yet effective passivation layers such as sulfur or carbon are preferred.  The next step in the SADP flow is spacer deposition, typically by conformal CVD or ALD of SiO2 or Si3N4. TiOx spacers are used in BEOL SADP. Because the outer side of the spacer is formed by deposition, LWR/LER performance is excellent at the outer edge. The inner edge is determined by the mandrel lithography, trim, and etch process. The trim step smoothens the sidewall. Therefore, one of the most outstanding properties of SADP is the excellent high- and medium-frequency LWR/LER performance.  Low-frequency LWR/LER is impacted by potential bending or buckling of the mandrel or the spacer. Both affect the space between the spacers, but not the width of the spacers, which is determined solely by deposition. To leverage this effect, positive and negative spacer schemes have been introduced.

Adding megasonic cleaning before brush scrubbing for removing small particles and reducing brush particle loading (significant particle contamination within the brush material) improves the overall particle performance [27]. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), as a result of its SiO2 etching capability, is used to reduce metallic contaminants, by stripping a thin, metal-contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Ideally, HF cleaning is performed after the particle removal with alkaline chemistry in the brush scrubbing step [28]. However, because of brush particle loading in the HF process and the relatively long DIW rinse time required after HF etching processing, HF cleaning is usually conducted before alkaline chemistry brush scrubbing. For advanced nodes, to achieve reduction of Si3N4 loss and minimization of feature topography, slurries with high removal rate selectivity (SiO2 vs. Si3N4) are needed. Therefore, slurries containing CeO2 particles are the preferred oxide CMP slurries [5]. Neither brush scrubbing nor megasonic cleaning with dilute NH4OH or SC-1 can effectively remove CeO2 particles.  HF cleaning in a brush box provides limited capability with respect to removing CeO2 particles, which is achieved by stripping a thin CeO2contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Wafer buffing with water or chemical on a polisher platen or a separate platen is required for more effective CeO2 particle removal.  For high-k metal gate fabrication, the dummy gate-open CMP step includes polishing the SiO2 film with highly selective slurries to stop on the Si3N4 surface [28]. This is followed by polishing of the oxide, nitride, and polySi films with a nonselective slurry to stop on polySi.

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: supply of fluorine across the fluorocarbon film to the interface and out-diffusion of the etching product (Oehrlein and Lee 1987).  Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: structures landing on metal, both Al and Cu, and trench structures for dual Damascene processes. Materials such as Cu (copper) and low-k (dielectric constant) dielectrics, along with small linewidths and high aspect ratios for both Al (aluminum) and Cu feature, require unique cleaning solutions developed specifically for BEOL processing. Depending on the device type (logic, memory, etc.), the types of material (Al or Cu, low-k), the BEOL interconnect scheme, and the number of interconnect layers, there could be as many as 50 BEOL cleaning steps.  ## 4.3.1 Aluminum Interconnect Cleaning  The Al metallization process involves either the subtractive etching of metal to form the metal interconnect lines or etching vias through silica to a previous metal layer. Each etching process generates a different type of PER. After etching the Al metal interconnect, cleaning typically consists of an in situ downstream O2 or H2/O2based plasma step for resist removal, followed by wet chemistry. Although the plasma may remove most, if not all, organic species, a Cl-containing residual film often remains on the sidewall surface.  The addition of a small amount of CF4 to the O2 or H2/O2 plasma can help fluorinate the embedded metallic contamination, rendering the metal complexes more soluble in the subsequent wet cleaning chemistries and DIW rinse. Residual Cl species are a concern because of possible subsequent metal corrosion if they are not removed. Chapter 7 covers plasma stripping and cleaning processes.  Wet cleaning chemical manufacturers are under constant challenges to develop more effective chemical formulations. In the early days of the semiconductor industry it was possible to use phenolic and/or hydrocarbon-based strippers to remove the photoresist [6,7], but in many cases the PER required high bath temperatures (>120C) to remove the residue. As the technologies evolved, newer solvent systems based on N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) or other polar solvents were developed. The\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: scrubbing either with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) or SC-1 (ammonium hydroxide [NH4OH] and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2] mixture) solution can remove the silica abrasive particles from the oxide surface [26]. Adding megasonic cleaning before brush scrubbing for removing small particles and reducing brush particle loading (significant particle contamination within the brush material) improves the overall particle performance [27]. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), as a result of its SiO2 etching capability, is used to reduce metallic contaminants, by stripping a thin, metal-contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Ideally, HF cleaning is performed after the particle removal with alkaline chemistry in the brush scrubbing step [28]. However, because of brush particle loading in the HF process and the relatively long DIW rinse time required after HF etching processing, HF cleaning is usually conducted before alkaline chemistry brush scrubbing. For advanced nodes, to achieve reduction of Si3N4 loss and minimization of feature topography, slurries with high removal rate selectivity (SiO2 vs. Si3N4) are needed. Therefore, slurries containing CeO2 particles are the preferred oxide CMP slurries [5]. Neither brush scrubbing nor megasonic cleaning with dilute NH4OH or SC-1 can effectively remove CeO2 particles.  HF cleaning in a brush box provides limited capability with respect to removing CeO2 particles, which is achieved by stripping a thin CeO2contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Wafer buffing with water or chemical on a polisher platen or a separate platen is required for more effective CeO2 particle removal.  For high-k metal gate fabrication, the dummy gate-open CMP step includes polishing the SiO2 film with highly selective slurries to stop on the Si3N4 surface [28]. This is followed by polishing of the oxide, nitride, and polySi films with a nonselective slurry to stop on polySi. For this process, the postCMP cleaning step must remove particles and residues from the\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: as an introduction to Chapter 6.  ## 1.4.6.3.2 Stripping Of Bulk Photoresist  Photoresists are essentially hydrocarbon polymers composed of a novolack resin, a photoactive compound and an organic solvent. The removal of bulk photoresist patterns is typically accomplished by reaction with atomic oxygen (O), which is created in the plasma environment by dissociation of molecular O2 [221,222]. Basically, two types of plasma reactors can be used to conduct the process both designed for single-wafer processing.  1. A design based on remote or downstream plasma generation 2. A design based on the combination of remote with RF, microwave, or ECR sources for downstream plasma generation with RF-assisted bias.  The preferred method of bulk photoresist stripping after plasma pattern etching or ion implantation now uses downstream reactors, which minimizes ion-induced surface damage while providing good control over reaction parameters with O2 [223]. The stripping rate can often be increased by adding specific gases or vapors to the O2 plasma such as F-containing gases [224], or H2O vapor, which provides additional benefits [225]. Device structures, which cannot withstand oxidation require a nonoxidizing environment. A mixture of typically 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 can then be used as the reactive gas in the plasma cleaning procedure [201].  Patterned photoresist is often used as a mask for the selective implantation of ions. During this process, the surface of the photoresist becomes hardened, making it difficult to remove the used resist layer. Low-energy treatment in an O2 plasma containing an optimally controlled quantity of H2O vapor can remove the resist without damage to the substrate [226].  ## 1.4.6.3.3 Removal Of Etch Residues  Plasma etching used for generating higheaspect ratio Si trenches requires the formation of an etching-resistant sidewall passivation layer to provide protection from lateral etching [227].

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: A detailed study has been made on the removal of sub-monolayer quantities of numerous contaminant metals [220].  Plasma stripping and cleaning. Reactions involved in the removal of bulk photoresist with plasma-generated atomic O were described [221,222], including the use of downstream reactors to minimize ion-induced surface damage [223]. Water vapor addition can be beneficial [225,226] and so is the use of 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 in creating a nonoxidizing environment [201].  The removal of complex etching residues from deep Si trenches [227] using reactive chemical species in a downstream microwave discharge was reported [228]. Metal etch residues with corrosive Cl impurities [222] require the use of in situ H2O-based downstream plasmas followed by wet-chemical cleaning [229]. Removal of etch residues by plasma treatments has been the subject of intensive studies to formulate effective processes. Predeposition cleaning and surface conditioning before gate dielectric formation under optimal conditions and plasma-assisted cleaning before epitaxy are additional critical operations that require carefully optimized procedures [231].  Cryogenic aerosol cleaning and conditioning. This emerging technology has received extensive attention during this period, as evident from the considerable amount of published papers. A theoretical analysis of cryogenic aerosol wafer cleaning has been reported [232]. Nondamaging cryogenic Ar/ N2 aerosols for cleaning IC device wafers with fragile interconnect structures have been used [233,234], including postpatterned BEOL cleaning of wafers with Cu metallization and low-k dielectrics [235]. Cryogenic aerosol processors for the fab are now available [233,234]. SCO2 cleaning has been demonstrated to remove submicron particles and residues from post-CMP treated surfaces more effectively than is resulting from other cleaning processes [240,241]. Organic impurities appear to be removable by a liquid CO2 phase [236e239]. Refined SCO2\n",

      "\n",
      "ANSWER: For the first stage HAR etch, a chlorine-based or fluorine-based gas chemistry would be suitable. Chlorine-based gas chemistries, such as HBr and oxygen, have been used in the past for polysilicon gate etching [1]. Fluorine-based gas chemistries, on the other hand, are commonly used for high aspect ratio etching of silicon and can provide good selectivity to oxide materials [2].\n",

      "In particular, a gas chemistry that includes fluorocarbon films (CxFy) could be beneficial for achieving high aspect ratio etching with good selectivity to oxide materials. These films have been shown to enhance the performance of reactive ion etching (RIE) and can provide good selectivity to silicon dioxide [3].\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that the specific gas chemistry used will depend on the exact requirements of the etch process, including the desired aspect ratio, selectivity, and etch rate.

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: supply of fluorine across the fluorocarbon film to the interface and out-diffusion of the etching product (Oehrlein and Lee 1987).  Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

The removal of bulk photoresist patterns is typically accomplished by reaction with atomic oxygen (O), which is created in the plasma environment by dissociation of molecular O2 [221,222]. Basically, two types of plasma reactors can be used to conduct the process both designed for single-wafer processing.  1. A design based on remote or downstream plasma generation 2. A design based on the combination of remote with RF, microwave, or ECR sources for downstream plasma generation with RF-assisted bias.  The preferred method of bulk photoresist stripping after plasma pattern etching or ion implantation now uses downstream reactors, which minimizes ion-induced surface damage while providing good control over reaction parameters with O2 [223]. The stripping rate can often be increased by adding specific gases or vapors to the O2 plasma such as F-containing gases [224], or H2O vapor, which provides additional benefits [225]. Device structures, which cannot withstand oxidation require a nonoxidizing environment. A mixture of typically 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 can then be used as the reactive gas in the plasma cleaning procedure [201].  Patterned photoresist is often used as a mask for the selective implantation of ions. During this process, the surface of the photoresist becomes hardened, making it difficult to remove the used resist layer. Low-energy treatment in an O2 plasma containing an optimally controlled quantity of H2O vapor can remove the resist without damage to the substrate [226].  ## 1.4.6.3.3 Removal Of Etch Residues  Plasma etching used for generating higheaspect ratio Si trenches requires the formation of an etching-resistant sidewall passivation layer to provide protection from lateral etching [227].

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: etch HfO2 selectively to silicon and silicon oxide, but the bias power must be controlled carefully to achieve selectivity as shown in Figure 7.40. In this experiment, a bias power of only 5 W was needed to achieve an etching rate of 30 Å/min and infinite selectivity to silicon and silicon oxide. The experiments were conducted in a 200 mm ICP reactor at 5 mTorr, a source power of 800 W, and 100 sccm BCl3. To improve the volatility of the etching products such as hafnium chloride, high temperature etching was introduced to gate etching (Helot et al. 2006). In another approach, hafnium oxide is etched at room temperature and the residues are removed in a wet etch process. The exposure to halogen radicals in combination with ion bombardment eases the removal by liquid-phase chemistries.  The mechanism for ion-enhanced chemical etching of hafnium aluminate thin films in Cl2/BCl3 plasmas at room temperature was investigated by Martin et al.  (2009). Several compositions of Hf1− xAlxOy thin films ranging from pure HfO2 to pure Al2O3 were etched in BCl3/Cl2 plasmas and their etch rates were found to scale with √Ei in both Cl2 and BCl3 plasmas. This indicates that the process is a sputtering process. In BCl3 plasma, deposition dominates at ion energies below 50 eV, while etching occurs above that energy with an etch rate three to seven times that in Cl2. This can be explained by the formation of more volatile boron-containing etching products such as (BOCl)3. This reaction pathway facilitates the abstraction of oxygen and etching of metallic aluminum and hafnium by chlorine species (Martin et al. 2009).  Because of etching challenges and limited materials integration flexibility in the \"gate first\" approach, the \"gate last\" integration dominated the industry beyond the 45 nm node. This choice turned out to be the right one to enable the next change in gate integration, the change from planar to FinFET gates (see Figure 7.37). Here, the polysilicon layer for sacrificial\n",

Adding megasonic cleaning before brush scrubbing for removing small particles and reducing brush particle loading (significant particle contamination within the brush material) improves the overall particle performance [27]. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), as a result of its SiO2 etching capability, is used to reduce metallic contaminants, by stripping a thin, metal-contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Ideally, HF cleaning is performed after the particle removal with alkaline chemistry in the brush scrubbing step [28]. However, because of brush particle loading in the HF process and the relatively long DIW rinse time required after HF etching processing, HF cleaning is usually conducted before alkaline chemistry brush scrubbing. For advanced nodes, to achieve reduction of Si3N4 loss and minimization of feature topography, slurries with high removal rate selectivity (SiO2 vs. Si3N4) are needed. Therefore, slurries containing CeO2 particles are the preferred oxide CMP slurries [5]. Neither brush scrubbing nor megasonic cleaning with dilute NH4OH or SC-1 can effectively remove CeO2 particles.  HF cleaning in a brush box provides limited capability with respect to removing CeO2 particles, which is achieved by stripping a thin CeO2contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Wafer buffing with water or chemical on a polisher platen or a separate platen is required for more effective CeO2 particle removal.  For high-k metal gate fabrication, the dummy gate-open CMP step includes polishing the SiO2 film with highly selective slurries to stop on the Si3N4 surface [28]. This is followed by polishing of the oxide, nitride, and polySi films with a nonselective slurry to stop on polySi. For this process, the postCMP cleaning step must remove particles and residues from the\n",

The high- and medium-frequency components of the roughness are not completely transferred during the gate patterning, allowing an LWR decrease at each plasma step. An overview on resist mask durability during plasma etching can be found in a review paper by Oehrlein et al. (2011).  RIE cannot improve low-frequency LER and LWR because the dimensions are too large to be removed by etching or deposition. However, RIE can cause resist and hardmask bending or toppling which worsens low frequency LER and LWR. The effect of line bending and toppling is a function of the aspect ratio of the line, as well as the stress and Young's modulus of the material. It is also called line buckling or wiggling. Stan et al. compared experimental and modeling results for thin lines made of a low-k dielectric (interlayer dielectric, ILD) and etched with a TiN hardmask (Stan et al. 2015). Such structures are used in patterning of trenches for copper metallization in the back end of line (BEOL) module of logic and memory devices.  The etched structures were measured by means of AFM. The etching depth was found to be one of the main control parameters for buckling. For the same width, buckling is more pronounced for the lines that are patterned deeper and have larger aspect ratios. The height of the TiN mask and the Young's modulus of the ILD, and the Young's modulus and compressive stress of the TiN mask are other parameters influencing buckling behavior. Line bending is induced by the compressive stress in the TiN mask and the work of the compressive forces is converted into bending energies of the structure. The stress of the ILD fin was 2 orders of magnitude lower than for TiN in the experiment and could be ignored. The line bending mechanism is illustrated in Figure 7.29.

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Future of plasma etching for microelectronics Challenges Source text: BEOL must deliver on three key metrics, which are typically in competition with each other: yield, reliability, and minimizing the resistance and capacitance (RC) delays. For conventional Cu interconnects, a bilayer liner is deposited onto the etched feature first.  The materials and thicknesses of the liner stack are chosen to obtain an excellent Cu diffusion barrier and adhesion between Cu and the interlayer dielectric (ILD).36 Figure 10(a) shows a sketch of an etched trench into the ILD with a TaN/Co liner bilayer. TaN is typically deposited using physical vapor deposition (PVD) and inherently has a bread loaf shape near the feature opening resulting in a thinner film in those areas that have reduced line of sight to the ionized species. The Co film has high conformality since it is deposited by CVD. The bilayer liner is then followed, all in situ, by a PVD Cu seed film, which also has bread loafs near the opening.  Even with an ideal profile as sketched in Fig. 10(a), it can be challenging for tight pitch configurations to find a process window where the liner and seed films are thick enough on the feature sidewalls while still leaving enough of an opening at the top of the feature to plate through. Figure 10(b) shows a high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image of a 48 nm pitch interconnect where small voids are visible near the sidewalls. The prewet step during Cu plating is designed to first remove the native Cu oxide and will galvanically attack the underlying Co if the original Cu seed is too thin on the sidewall. These Cu voids then result in a fast Cu electromigration path and significantly reduce the interconnect lifetime. It is, therefore, paramount to optimize the plasma etching and produce a feature that is friendly for the PVD processes that follow.  The etched profile gets more complicated in Fig. 11(a), which shows a dual damascene V1/M2 profile landing on M1. The etch stop and hardmask are each depicted\n",

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001). Figure 7.16 depicts experimental results that were\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: However, with the implementation of finFET (fin field effect transistor) architectures since the 22-nm node, these fin structures are extremely sensitive.  In the case of fins, the clean immediately following the dry etch that forms the fin is extremely sensitive to damage, because of its thin width and high aspect ratio. Etch residues must be removed without physical damage and the closely spaced features dried without stiction-related collapse. In the case of gate feature patterns, photoresist striping is especially sensitive because of the potential loss of material. After ion implantation with a photoresist mask, a sequence of plasma stripeSPMeSC-1 is typically used to remove the photoresist. This combination leads to: 1. Consumption of Si because of the combination of oxidation and etching.  2. Potential damage to narrow (<2 nm) polySi gate lines from the physical energy used for particle removal.  Silicon consumption, historically, was not a problem, but the number of implantation steps after gate formation has increased as the doping profiles have become shallower; therefore, more Si undesirably is consumed. Of course, SC-1 can be processed at reduced concentration, temperature, and/or time to minimize the consumption, but this can compromise PRE, which also is affected by reducing or eliminating the use of megasonic processing because of pattern damage. Optimization and the development of nondamaging cleaning with megasonic energy or jet spray are being carried out by various research groups.  Logic FEOL integration schemes have demonstrated the use of Ge as a channel material for PMOS (p-channel MOS), because of its high carrier mobility [161]. Currently, SiGe is in production use, with the content of Ge in these films expected to increase until the ultimate limit of pure Ge. Meanwhile, III-V materials have been proposed to realize electron mobility improvement in NMOS (n-channel MOS) [162]. These new materials represent a fundamental shift from the\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: as an introduction to Chapter 6.  ## 1.4.6.3.2 Stripping Of Bulk Photoresist  Photoresists are essentially hydrocarbon polymers composed of a novolack resin, a photoactive compound and an organic solvent. The removal of bulk photoresist patterns is typically accomplished by reaction with atomic oxygen (O), which is created in the plasma environment by dissociation of molecular O2 [221,222]. Basically, two types of plasma reactors can be used to conduct the process both designed for single-wafer processing.  1. A design based on remote or downstream plasma generation 2. A design based on the combination of remote with RF, microwave, or ECR sources for downstream plasma generation with RF-assisted bias.  The preferred method of bulk photoresist stripping after plasma pattern etching or ion implantation now uses downstream reactors, which minimizes ion-induced surface damage while providing good control over reaction parameters with O2 [223]. The stripping rate can often be increased by adding specific gases or vapors to the O2 plasma such as F-containing gases [224], or H2O vapor, which provides additional benefits [225]. Device structures, which cannot withstand oxidation require a nonoxidizing environment. A mixture of typically 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 can then be used as the reactive gas in the plasma cleaning procedure [201].  Patterned photoresist is often used as a mask for the selective implantation of ions. During this process, the surface of the photoresist becomes hardened, making it difficult to remove the used resist layer. Low-energy treatment in an O2 plasma containing an optimally controlled quantity of H2O vapor can remove the resist without damage to the substrate [226].  ## 1.4.6.3.3 Removal Of Etch Residues  Plasma etching used for generating higheaspect ratio Si trenches requires the formation of an etching-resistant sidewall passivation layer to provide protection from lateral etching [227].

      "\n",
      "ANSWER: To achieve a high selectivity ratio of 22:1 (poly-silicon to SiO2) using directional atomic layer etching (ALE), several factors need to be considered. First, the choice of gas chemistry is critical. Fluorocarbon-based gases such as CxFy have been shown to provide good selectivity for silicon over oxide materials [1].\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the gas chemistry, the process parameters such as ion energy and wafer temperature also play a crucial role in achieving high selectivity. A higher ion energy can increase the etching rate of poly-silicon but may also lead to increased damage to the SiO2 layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "To minimize damage to the SiO2 layer, a lower ion energy may be beneficial. However, this needs to be balanced against the requirement for a high etching rate of poly-silicon.\n",

      "In terms of wafer temperature, higher temperatures can improve the volatility of etching products and enhance the etching rate [2]. However, excessive heat can also lead to increased damage to the SiO2 layer.\n",

Plasma stripping and cleaning. Reactions involved in the removal of bulk photoresist with plasma-generated atomic O were described [221,222], including the use of downstream reactors to minimize ion-induced surface damage [223]. Water vapor addition can be beneficial [225,226] and so is the use of 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 in creating a nonoxidizing environment [201].  The removal of complex etching residues from deep Si trenches [227] using reactive chemical species in a downstream microwave discharge was reported [228]. Metal etch residues with corrosive Cl impurities [222] require the use of in situ H2O-based downstream plasmas followed by wet-chemical cleaning [229]. Removal of etch residues by plasma treatments has been the subject of intensive studies to formulate effective processes. Predeposition cleaning and surface conditioning before gate dielectric formation under optimal conditions and plasma-assisted cleaning before epitaxy are additional critical operations that require carefully optimized procedures [231].  Cryogenic aerosol cleaning and conditioning. This emerging technology has received extensive attention during this period, as evident from the considerable amount of published papers. A theoretical analysis of cryogenic aerosol wafer cleaning has been reported [232]. Nondamaging cryogenic Ar/ N2 aerosols for cleaning IC device wafers with fragile interconnect structures have been used [233,234], including postpatterned BEOL cleaning of wafers with Cu metallization and low-k dielectrics [235]. Cryogenic aerosol processors for the fab are now available [233,234]. SCO2 cleaning has been demonstrated to remove submicron particles and residues from post-CMP treated surfaces more effectively than is resulting from other cleaning processes [240,241]. Organic impurities appear to be removable by a liquid CO2 phase [236e239]. Refined SCO2\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: Many of these cleaning chemistries contain solvents with caustic components that will attack these materials. Since Cu is even more susceptible to corrosion than Al, earlier types of solvent chemistries (including hydroxylamine-based chemistries) have proved to be too aggressive. The wet chemical suppliers have responded by designing compositions with higher H2O content (60e90 wt%). These chemistries can be acidic, mildly basic (pH 7.5w8.5) with an F-based additive, or strongly basic (pH > 11).  Most of the commercially available compositions are custom formulations with very specific concentration(s) of the active ingredient(s). Each component performs a particular function. For example, aprotic solvents are classified as molecules that do not contain an OeH bond, such as diethyl ether and acetone.  On the other hand, protic solvent molecules contain a H atom attached to an electronegative atom, such as O, with the general formula ROH.  ## 4.3.2.1 Fluoride-Based Chemistry  In Cu interconnect BEOL cleaning applications, aqueous, semiaqueous, and solvent-based strippers containing fluoride were developed for photoresist and dielectric masked PER removal. In recent years, as technology nodes advanced to 65 nm and beyond, the device dimensions became smaller and the etching mask became thinner. At these nodes, TiN (titanium nitride) metal hardmask, as opposed to photoresist and dielectric masks, is used to increase the etching selectivity between the mask and low-k materials. Formulations of various fluoride-based cleaning chemistries are shown in Table 4.3-5.  ## 4.3.2.2 Oxidizing-Based Chemistry  As technology nodes have advanced beyond 45 nm, achieving critical profile control of trenches and vias has become more challenging. A TiN metal hardmask is used to increase RIE selectivity to the underlying low-k materials to achieve better profile control. In addition, undercutting the hardmask can generate voids during subsequent barrier metal, Cu seed layer, and Cu\n",

Examples of material used for aqueous processing equipment and components are perfluoroalkoxy (PFA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and oxy-1,4-phenylene-oxy-1,4-phenylenecarbonyl-1,4-phenylene, also known as polyetheretherketone (PEEK). Polyvinylchloride (PVC) has been shown to shed particles and thus is rarely used for aqueous tool components. PEEK is the material that is recommended for DIW transport systems because of its smooth surface properties, lower leaching potential, and temperature insensitivity; however, it is very expensive.  Stainless steel and other metal components must be avoided; stainless steel has the potential to add metallic contaminants into the H2O stream.  ## 4.7.1 Immersion Wet Benches  Batch wet-chemical cleaning systems are either immersion based or spin spray based. Immersion wet stations consist of one or more chemical baths, rinse tanks, and dryers. A wafer cassette is first immersed in the chemical bath for a specified length of time and then transported to the rinse tank. Highproductivity immersion tank systems are fully automated with robotic transfer of the wafer cassettes from the 300-mm front opening unified pod to the carrier used to process the wafers through the system. In some cases, the robot may hold the wafers throughout the entire process with a specially designed arm (\"cassette-less\") or the robot may transfer the wafers to specially designed cassettes that minimize the touch points on the wafer surface, thus minimizing shielding of the wafer surface, the volume of chemical displaced by the cassette, and the amount of chemical carried over to the rinse tank. Materials used for the carrier and the robot must be compatible with all of the chemicals used in the wet bench. Cross-contamination of the robot must be avoided, and thus, most immersion wet bench systems are designed with a robot cleaner.  Immersion baths can reuse the chemical solutions for several\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: However, with the implementation of finFET (fin field effect transistor) architectures since the 22-nm node, these fin structures are extremely sensitive.  In the case of fins, the clean immediately following the dry etch that forms the fin is extremely sensitive to damage, because of its thin width and high aspect ratio. Etch residues must be removed without physical damage and the closely spaced features dried without stiction-related collapse. In the case of gate feature patterns, photoresist striping is especially sensitive because of the potential loss of material. After ion implantation with a photoresist mask, a sequence of plasma stripeSPMeSC-1 is typically used to remove the photoresist. This combination leads to: 1. Consumption of Si because of the combination of oxidation and etching.  2. Potential damage to narrow (<2 nm) polySi gate lines from the physical energy used for particle removal.  Silicon consumption, historically, was not a problem, but the number of implantation steps after gate formation has increased as the doping profiles have become shallower; therefore, more Si undesirably is consumed. Of course, SC-1 can be processed at reduced concentration, temperature, and/or time to minimize the consumption, but this can compromise PRE, which also is affected by reducing or eliminating the use of megasonic processing because of pattern damage. Optimization and the development of nondamaging cleaning with megasonic energy or jet spray are being carried out by various research groups.  Logic FEOL integration schemes have demonstrated the use of Ge as a channel material for PMOS (p-channel MOS), because of its high carrier mobility [161]. Currently, SiGe is in production use, with the content of Ge in these films expected to increase until the ultimate limit of pure Ge. Meanwhile, III-V materials have been proposed to realize electron mobility improvement in NMOS (n-channel MOS) [162]. These new materials represent a fundamental shift from the\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Future of plasma etching for microelectronics Challenges Source text: BEOL must deliver on three key metrics, which are typically in competition with each other: yield, reliability, and minimizing the resistance and capacitance (RC) delays. For conventional Cu interconnects, a bilayer liner is deposited onto the etched feature first.  The materials and thicknesses of the liner stack are chosen to obtain an excellent Cu diffusion barrier and adhesion between Cu and the interlayer dielectric (ILD).36 Figure 10(a) shows a sketch of an etched trench into the ILD with a TaN/Co liner bilayer. TaN is typically deposited using physical vapor deposition (PVD) and inherently has a bread loaf shape near the feature opening resulting in a thinner film in those areas that have reduced line of sight to the ionized species. The Co film has high conformality since it is deposited by CVD. The bilayer liner is then followed, all in situ, by a PVD Cu seed film, which also has bread loafs near the opening.  Even with an ideal profile as sketched in Fig. 10(a), it can be challenging for tight pitch configurations to find a process window where the liner and seed films are thick enough on the feature sidewalls while still leaving enough of an opening at the top of the feature to plate through. Figure 10(b) shows a high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image of a 48 nm pitch interconnect where small voids are visible near the sidewalls. The prewet step during Cu plating is designed to first remove the native Cu oxide and will galvanically attack the underlying Co if the original Cu seed is too thin on the sidewall. These Cu voids then result in a fast Cu electromigration path and significantly reduce the interconnect lifetime. It is, therefore, paramount to optimize the plasma etching and produce a feature that is friendly for the PVD processes that follow.  The etched profile gets more complicated in Fig. 11(a), which shows a dual damascene V1/M2 profile landing on M1. The etch stop and hardmask are each depicted\n",

In the case of fins, the clean immediately following the dry etch that forms the fin is extremely sensitive to damage, because of its thin width and high aspect ratio. Etch residues must be removed without physical damage and the closely spaced features dried without stiction-related collapse. In the case of gate feature patterns, photoresist striping is especially sensitive because of the potential loss of material. After ion implantation with a photoresist mask, a sequence of plasma stripeSPMeSC-1 is typically used to remove the photoresist. This combination leads to: 1. Consumption of Si because of the combination of oxidation and etching.  2. Potential damage to narrow (<2 nm) polySi gate lines from the physical energy used for particle removal.  Silicon consumption, historically, was not a problem, but the number of implantation steps after gate formation has increased as the doping profiles have become shallower; therefore, more Si undesirably is consumed. Of course, SC-1 can be processed at reduced concentration, temperature, and/or time to minimize the consumption, but this can compromise PRE, which also is affected by reducing or eliminating the use of megasonic processing because of pattern damage. Optimization and the development of nondamaging cleaning with megasonic energy or jet spray are being carried out by various research groups.  Logic FEOL integration schemes have demonstrated the use of Ge as a channel material for PMOS (p-channel MOS), because of its high carrier mobility [161]. Currently, SiGe is in production use, with the content of Ge in these films expected to increase until the ultimate limit of pure Ge. Meanwhile, III-V materials have been proposed to realize electron mobility improvement in NMOS (n-channel MOS) [162]. These new materials represent a fundamental shift from the\n",

If descum is too gentle, it is not effective in cleaning up incoming defects.  Figure 7 highlights the impact of different descum chemistries on the overall microbridges performance. As the descum chemistry gets more aggressive, the mini defect modes reduce. The aggressiveness of the descum increases going from N2 based plasma to H2/N2 based plasma. The defect level does not drop meaningfully until a fluorinated chemistry is used for residue removal. Additional optimization of the fluorine-based chemistry provided a significant reduction in defectivity while minimizing overall resist loss and improving the process window. Additionally, the overall mini defect counts are insensitive to CDs when the descum etch is  FIG. 7. Impact of descum on the microbridges defect mode for fine pitch L/S EUV patterning. J. Vac. Sci.

Following the descum step, the underlayer etch needs to be completed with minimal resist loss to prevent shorting modes and maintain a straight profile through the underlayer. Chemistry selection plays a critical role in this etch. As such, significant optimization is needed for the etching chemistry, and RF parameters, pressure, and gas flow are selected for optimal etch. Recent advances in multistate RF pulsing have been shown to provide additional process control for etching.33 Taking advantage of these new capabilities, end-pointed underlayer etches have been developed to enable good selectivity while maintaining excellent process control, defectivity, and profiles.  The secondary source of mini defects is small particles or impurities in the material stack that cannot be removed by the descum step. The impact of these defects increases with smaller pitches.

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: Many of these cleaning chemistries contain solvents with caustic components that will attack these materials. Since Cu is even more susceptible to corrosion than Al, earlier types of solvent chemistries (including hydroxylamine-based chemistries) have proved to be too aggressive. The wet chemical suppliers have responded by designing compositions with higher H2O content (60e90 wt%). These chemistries can be acidic, mildly basic (pH 7.5w8.5) with an F-based additive, or strongly basic (pH > 11).  Most of the commercially available compositions are custom formulations with very specific concentration(s) of the active ingredient(s). Each component performs a particular function. For example, aprotic solvents are classified as molecules that do not contain an OeH bond, such as diethyl ether and acetone.  On the other hand, protic solvent molecules contain a H atom attached to an electronegative atom, such as O, with the general formula ROH.  ## 4.3.2.1 Fluoride-Based Chemistry  In Cu interconnect BEOL cleaning applications, aqueous, semiaqueous, and solvent-based strippers containing fluoride were developed for photoresist and dielectric masked PER removal. In recent years, as technology nodes advanced to 65 nm and beyond, the device dimensions became smaller and the etching mask became thinner. At these nodes, TiN (titanium nitride) metal hardmask, as opposed to photoresist and dielectric masks, is used to increase the etching selectivity between the mask and low-k materials. Formulations of various fluoride-based cleaning chemistries are shown in Table 4.3-5.  ## 4.3.2.2 Oxidizing-Based Chemistry  As technology nodes have advanced beyond 45 nm, achieving critical profile control of trenches and vias has become more challenging. A TiN metal hardmask is used to increase RIE selectivity to the underlying low-k materials to achieve better profile control. In addition, undercutting the hardmask can generate voids during subsequent barrier metal, Cu seed layer, and Cu\n",

      "In conclusion, achieving a high aspect ratio etch in the first stage and a selective etch with a high selectivity ratio of 22:1 (poly-silicon to SiO2) in the second stage requires careful consideration of gas chemistries, process parameters, and additional factors such as sidewall protection and debris reduction. By optimizing these factors, it is possible to achieve high-quality features with minimal defects.\n",

The organic material can be effectively removed using plasma processes. Depending on the wavelength used for lithography, various additives and solvents are incorporated into the photoresist formulation; for instance, PACs such as diazo-based materials and photoacid generators such as onium salts are typically used. Fortunately, most of these additives are easily stripped in both oxidizing and reducing chemistries.  The stripping and cleaning processes require high-purity gases; typically, 99.9999% purity is used. In-line purifiers have been employed to further reduce unwanted background contamination, although oxidizing plasma stripping processes have a high tolerance for contaminants such as H2O and H2. Reducing processes are also forgiving. However, for Si wafer conditioning, reducing chemistries that contain H2O and O2 are easily plasma activated and can oxidize sample surfaces. Most IC manufacturers rely on bulk delivery of gases with appropriate filters and purifiers. Mass flow controllers are used to monitor and deliver precise quantities of gases into the reaction chamber.  Oxidizing Chemistries: Oxidizing chemistries are typically composed of O2 plus a carrier gas and additives. The oxidizing species can be O2, H2O, or N2O or other gases containing an O atom. Because photoresist is composed of hydrocarbons, the O2 plasmas generate O, which easily reacts with this film to form volatile byproducts:  $${\\bf C}_{n}{\\bf H}_{m}+\\left(n+\\frac{m}{2}\\right){\\bf O}_{2}\\!\\rightarrow\\!n\\;{\\bf CO}_{2}+\\frac{m}{2}\\;{\\bf H}_{2}{\\bf O}.$$ (7.3-1) Small amounts of N2 (3e5 vol%) have been shown to promote dissociation of O2 to increase the stripping rate [138,142], whereas adding more N2 decreases the etching rate. Oxygen is also used to react with implanted species, creating the stable oxides of P: P4O10, As: As2O5, and B: B2O3. These residues can be rinsed off the surface or cleaned in a\n",

Volume ratios of 2:1e4:1 are used at a temperature of 100e130C for 10e15 min. Organics are destroyed and eliminated by wet-chemical oxidation, but inorganic contaminants, such as metals, are not desorbed. What is worse, the Si surface after this cleaning step is strongly contaminated with S (sulfur) residues from the H2SO4 [94e97].  These SPM, which are also known as \"piranha etch\" (because of their voracious ability to eradicate organics) or, incorrectly, \"Caros acid,\" are extremely dangerous to handle in the fab; goggles, face shields, and plastic gloves are needed to protect the operators. This procedure is usually the first cleaning process to prepare grossly contaminated FEOL Si wafers for subsequent treatments. Vigorous rinsing with DIW is required to completely remove the viscous liquid. Finally, it is advantageous after the DIW rinsing to strip the impurity-containing formed oxide film on Si or on the thermal SiO2 layer by dipping the wafers for 15 s in HFeH2O (1:50), followed by a DIW rinse. A modification can be made by adding minute amounts of HF to the SPM, which results in better removal of sulfur compounds, shorter rinsing times, and improved particle removal [94].  Some alternative oxidants are sometimes used instead of H2O2 in an effort to improve the stability of the mixtures. These alternative additives include ammonium persulfate (NH4)2SO4, known as SA-80 when combined with H2SO4 [98]; peroxydisulfuric acid (H2S2O8), called \"Caros acid\" when combined with H2SO4 [99]; and ozonated H2O, DIW/O3, called sulfuric acide ozone mixture (SOM) when combined with H2SO4 [100].  ## 1.4.2.3 Original Rca Cleaning Process  The first successful process for wet-cleaning FEOL Si wafers was systematically developed at RCA, used for several years in the fabs, and finally published in 1970\n",

Plasma stripping and cleaning. Reactions involved in the removal of bulk photoresist with plasma-generated atomic O were described [221,222], including the use of downstream reactors to minimize ion-induced surface damage [223]. Water vapor addition can be beneficial [225,226] and so is the use of 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 in creating a nonoxidizing environment [201].  The removal of complex etching residues from deep Si trenches [227] using reactive chemical species in a downstream microwave discharge was reported [228]. Metal etch residues with corrosive Cl impurities [222] require the use of in situ H2O-based downstream plasmas followed by wet-chemical cleaning [229]. Removal of etch residues by plasma treatments has been the subject of intensive studies to formulate effective processes. Predeposition cleaning and surface conditioning before gate dielectric formation under optimal conditions and plasma-assisted cleaning before epitaxy are additional critical operations that require carefully optimized procedures [231].  Cryogenic aerosol cleaning and conditioning. This emerging technology has received extensive attention during this period, as evident from the considerable amount of published papers. A theoretical analysis of cryogenic aerosol wafer cleaning has been reported [232]. Nondamaging cryogenic Ar/ N2 aerosols for cleaning IC device wafers with fragile interconnect structures have been used [233,234], including postpatterned BEOL cleaning of wafers with Cu metallization and low-k dielectrics [235]. Cryogenic aerosol processors for the fab are now available [233,234]. SCO2 cleaning has been demonstrated to remove submicron particles and residues from post-CMP treated surfaces more effectively than is resulting from other cleaning processes [240,241]. Organic impurities appear to be removable by a liquid CO2 phase [236e239]. Refined SCO2\n",

Since Cu is even more susceptible to corrosion than Al, earlier types of solvent chemistries (including hydroxylamine-based chemistries) have proved to be too aggressive. The wet chemical suppliers have responded by designing compositions with higher H2O content (60e90 wt%). These chemistries can be acidic, mildly basic (pH 7.5w8.5) with an F-based additive, or strongly basic (pH > 11).  Most of the commercially available compositions are custom formulations with very specific concentration(s) of the active ingredient(s). Each component performs a particular function. For example, aprotic solvents are classified as molecules that do not contain an OeH bond, such as diethyl ether and acetone.  On the other hand, protic solvent molecules contain a H atom attached to an electronegative atom, such as O, with the general formula ROH.  ## 4.3.2.1 Fluoride-Based Chemistry  In Cu interconnect BEOL cleaning applications, aqueous, semiaqueous, and solvent-based strippers containing fluoride were developed for photoresist and dielectric masked PER removal. In recent years, as technology nodes advanced to 65 nm and beyond, the device dimensions became smaller and the etching mask became thinner. At these nodes, TiN (titanium nitride) metal hardmask, as opposed to photoresist and dielectric masks, is used to increase the etching selectivity between the mask and low-k materials. Formulations of various fluoride-based cleaning chemistries are shown in Table 4.3-5.  ## 4.3.2.2 Oxidizing-Based Chemistry  As technology nodes have advanced beyond 45 nm, achieving critical profile control of trenches and vias has become more challenging. A TiN metal hardmask is used to increase RIE selectivity to the underlying low-k materials to achieve better profile control. In addition, undercutting the hardmask can generate voids during subsequent barrier metal, Cu seed layer, and Cu\n",

Plasma stripping and cleaning. Reactions involved in the removal of bulk photoresist with plasma-generated atomic O were described [221,222], including the use of downstream reactors to minimize ion-induced surface damage [223]. Water vapor addition can be beneficial [225,226] and so is the use of 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 in creating a nonoxidizing environment [201].  The removal of complex etching residues from deep Si trenches [227] using reactive chemical species in a downstream microwave discharge was reported [228]. Metal etch residues with corrosive Cl impurities [222] require the use of in situ H2O-based downstream plasmas followed by wet-chemical cleaning [229]. Removal of etch residues by plasma treatments has been the subject of intensive studies to formulate effective processes. Predeposition cleaning and surface conditioning before gate dielectric formation under optimal conditions and plasma-assisted cleaning before epitaxy are additional critical operations that require carefully optimized procedures [231].  Cryogenic aerosol cleaning and conditioning. This emerging technology has received extensive attention during this period, as evident from the considerable amount of published papers. A theoretical analysis of cryogenic aerosol wafer cleaning has been reported [232]. Nondamaging cryogenic Ar/ N2 aerosols for cleaning IC device wafers with fragile interconnect structures have been used [233,234], including postpatterned BEOL cleaning of wafers with Cu metallization and low-k dielectrics [235]. Cryogenic aerosol processors for the fab are now available [233,234]. SCO2 cleaning has been demonstrated to remove submicron particles and residues from post-CMP treated surfaces more effectively than is resulting from other cleaning processes [240,241].

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: as an introduction to Chapter 6.  ## 1.4.6.3.2 Stripping Of Bulk Photoresist  Photoresists are essentially hydrocarbon polymers composed of a novolack resin, a photoactive compound and an organic solvent. The removal of bulk photoresist patterns is typically accomplished by reaction with atomic oxygen (O), which is created in the plasma environment by dissociation of molecular O2 [221,222]. Basically, two types of plasma reactors can be used to conduct the process both designed for single-wafer processing.  1. A design based on remote or downstream plasma generation 2. A design based on the combination of remote with RF, microwave, or ECR sources for downstream plasma generation with RF-assisted bias.  The preferred method of bulk photoresist stripping after plasma pattern etching or ion implantation now uses downstream reactors, which minimizes ion-induced surface damage while providing good control over reaction parameters with O2 [223]. The stripping rate can often be increased by adding specific gases or vapors to the O2 plasma such as F-containing gases [224], or H2O vapor, which provides additional benefits [225]. Device structures, which cannot withstand oxidation require a nonoxidizing environment. A mixture of typically 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 can then be used as the reactive gas in the plasma cleaning procedure [201].  Patterned photoresist is often used as a mask for the selective implantation of ions. During this process, the surface of the photoresist becomes hardened, making it difficult to remove the used resist layer. Low-energy treatment in an O2 plasma containing an optimally controlled quantity of H2O vapor can remove the resist without damage to the substrate [226].  ## 1.4.6.3.3 Removal Of Etch Residues  Plasma etching used for generating higheaspect ratio Si trenches requires the formation of an etching-resistant sidewall passivation layer to provide protection from lateral etching [227].

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: scrubbing either with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) or SC-1 (ammonium hydroxide [NH4OH] and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2] mixture) solution can remove the silica abrasive particles from the oxide surface [26]. Adding megasonic cleaning before brush scrubbing for removing small particles and reducing brush particle loading (significant particle contamination within the brush material) improves the overall particle performance [27]. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), as a result of its SiO2 etching capability, is used to reduce metallic contaminants, by stripping a thin, metal-contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Ideally, HF cleaning is performed after the particle removal with alkaline chemistry in the brush scrubbing step [28]. However, because of brush particle loading in the HF process and the relatively long DIW rinse time required after HF etching processing, HF cleaning is usually conducted before alkaline chemistry brush scrubbing. For advanced nodes, to achieve reduction of Si3N4 loss and minimization of feature topography, slurries with high removal rate selectivity (SiO2 vs. Si3N4) are needed. Therefore, slurries containing CeO2 particles are the preferred oxide CMP slurries [5]. Neither brush scrubbing nor megasonic cleaning with dilute NH4OH or SC-1 can effectively remove CeO2 particles.  HF cleaning in a brush box provides limited capability with respect to removing CeO2 particles, which is achieved by stripping a thin CeO2contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Wafer buffing with water or chemical on a polisher platen or a separate platen is required for more effective CeO2 particle removal.  For high-k metal gate fabrication, the dummy gate-open CMP step includes polishing the SiO2 film with highly selective slurries to stop on the Si3N4 surface [28]. This is followed by polishing of the oxide, nitride, and polySi films with a nonselective slurry to stop on polySi. For this process, the postCMP cleaning step must remove particles and residues from the\n",

IC manufacturers have replaced physical vapor deposition (PVD) Ta with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) Co (cobalt) liners for advanced nodes [168]. The challenge with Co liner is the galvanic corrosion of the Co that occurs when Cu and Co are in contact with one another, which establishes electrical contact in the cleaning solution [169]. Another widely studied liner candidate is ruthenium (Ru) [170]. When Cu and Ru are in electrical contact in the cleaning solution, it is the Cu that is corroded [171]. Wet cleaning formulation manufactures have put considerable effort into developing cleaning solutions to overcome this issue. In addition to these new liner materials, CVD TiN has been considered as a candidate to replace the PVD TaN barrier layer for the metal 1 contact layer. The challenge, in this case, is to have a cleaning solution that removes the PVD TiN mask (about 300 A˚ ) and still is compatible with CVD TiN barrier.  Reducing the etch stop layer thickness is necessary to realize a lower capacitance for BEOL dual Damascene dielectric layers [172]. Compared with conventional SiCN etch stop layers, AlN (aluminum nitride), AlxOy (aluminum oxide), and other Al compounds are attractive because they exhibit a low etching rate with fluorine-containing gas plasma chemistry because of the predominant formation of AlF3, a low-volatility by-product [173,174]. Some IC manufacturers have replaced SiCN with AlN or AlxOy to improve etch selectivity between the low-k and etch-stop layer. There is a problem when using AlN or AlxOy for etch-stop layers in patterned wafers. During low-k etching, the AlN/AlxOy becomes damaged by exposure to fluorine-containing gas plasma and forms AlF3, which is nonvolatile, but water soluble. This poses a serious formulation challenge for wet cleaning manufacturers, because the AlN is removed when it is dissolved in DIW during the\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: scrubbing either with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) or SC-1 (ammonium hydroxide [NH4OH] and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2] mixture) solution can remove the silica abrasive particles from the oxide surface [26]. Adding megasonic cleaning before brush scrubbing for removing small particles and reducing brush particle loading (significant particle contamination within the brush material) improves the overall particle performance [27]. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), as a result of its SiO2 etching capability, is used to reduce metallic contaminants, by stripping a thin, metal-contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Ideally, HF cleaning is performed after the particle removal with alkaline chemistry in the brush scrubbing step [28]. However, because of brush particle loading in the HF process and the relatively long DIW rinse time required after HF etching processing, HF cleaning is usually conducted before alkaline chemistry brush scrubbing. For advanced nodes, to achieve reduction of Si3N4 loss and minimization of feature topography, slurries with high removal rate selectivity (SiO2 vs. Si3N4) are needed. Therefore, slurries containing CeO2 particles are the preferred oxide CMP slurries [5]. Neither brush scrubbing nor megasonic cleaning with dilute NH4OH or SC-1 can effectively remove CeO2 particles.  HF cleaning in a brush box provides limited capability with respect to removing CeO2 particles, which is achieved by stripping a thin CeO2contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Wafer buffing with water or chemical on a polisher platen or a separate platen is required for more effective CeO2 particle removal.  For high-k metal gate fabrication, the dummy gate-open CMP step includes polishing the SiO2 film with highly selective slurries to stop on the Si3N4 surface [28]. This is followed by polishing of the oxide, nitride, and polySi films with a nonselective slurry to stop on polySi. For this process, the postCMP cleaning step must remove particles and residues from the\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: A detailed study has been made on the removal of sub-monolayer quantities of numerous contaminant metals [220].  Plasma stripping and cleaning. Reactions involved in the removal of bulk photoresist with plasma-generated atomic O were described [221,222], including the use of downstream reactors to minimize ion-induced surface damage [223]. Water vapor addition can be beneficial [225,226] and so is the use of 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 in creating a nonoxidizing environment [201].  The removal of complex etching residues from deep Si trenches [227] using reactive chemical species in a downstream microwave discharge was reported [228]. Metal etch residues with corrosive Cl impurities [222] require the use of in situ H2O-based downstream plasmas followed by wet-chemical cleaning [229]. Removal of etch residues by plasma treatments has been the subject of intensive studies to formulate effective processes. Predeposition cleaning and surface conditioning before gate dielectric formation under optimal conditions and plasma-assisted cleaning before epitaxy are additional critical operations that require carefully optimized procedures [231].  Cryogenic aerosol cleaning and conditioning. This emerging technology has received extensive attention during this period, as evident from the considerable amount of published papers. A theoretical analysis of cryogenic aerosol wafer cleaning has been reported [232]. Nondamaging cryogenic Ar/ N2 aerosols for cleaning IC device wafers with fragile interconnect structures have been used [233,234], including postpatterned BEOL cleaning of wafers with Cu metallization and low-k dielectrics [235]. Cryogenic aerosol processors for the fab are now available [233,234]. SCO2 cleaning has been demonstrated to remove submicron particles and residues from post-CMP treated surfaces more effectively than is resulting from other cleaning processes [240,241]. Organic impurities appear to be removable by a liquid CO2 phase [236e239]. Refined SCO2\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: polymer patterns after ion implantation and other visible contaminants of organic nature, can be accomplished by using mixtures of 98 wt% H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) and 30 wt% H2O2. Volume ratios of 2:1e4:1 are used at a temperature of 100e130C for 10e15 min. Organics are destroyed and eliminated by wet-chemical oxidation, but inorganic contaminants, such as metals, are not desorbed. What is worse, the Si surface after this cleaning step is strongly contaminated with S (sulfur) residues from the H2SO4 [94e97].  These SPM, which are also known as \"piranha etch\" (because of their voracious ability to eradicate organics) or, incorrectly, \"Caros acid,\" are extremely dangerous to handle in the fab; goggles, face shields, and plastic gloves are needed to protect the operators. This procedure is usually the first cleaning process to prepare grossly contaminated FEOL Si wafers for subsequent treatments. Vigorous rinsing with DIW is required to completely remove the viscous liquid. Finally, it is advantageous after the DIW rinsing to strip the impurity-containing formed oxide film on Si or on the thermal SiO2 layer by dipping the wafers for 15 s in HFeH2O (1:50), followed by a DIW rinse. A modification can be made by adding minute amounts of HF to the SPM, which results in better removal of sulfur compounds, shorter rinsing times, and improved particle removal [94].  Some alternative oxidants are sometimes used instead of H2O2 in an effort to improve the stability of the mixtures. These alternative additives include ammonium persulfate (NH4)2SO4, known as SA-80 when combined with H2SO4 [98]; peroxydisulfuric acid (H2S2O8), called \"Caros acid\" when combined with H2SO4 [99]; and ozonated H2O, DIW/O3, called sulfuric acide ozone mixture (SOM) when combined with H2SO4 [100].  ## 1.4.2.3 Original Rca Cleaning Process  The first successful process for wet-cleaning FEOL Si wafers was systematically developed at RCA, used for several years in the fabs, and finally published in 1970\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: Many of these cleaning chemistries contain solvents with caustic components that will attack these materials. Since Cu is even more susceptible to corrosion than Al, earlier types of solvent chemistries (including hydroxylamine-based chemistries) have proved to be too aggressive. The wet chemical suppliers have responded by designing compositions with higher H2O content (60e90 wt%). These chemistries can be acidic, mildly basic (pH 7.5w8.5) with an F-based additive, or strongly basic (pH > 11).  Most of the commercially available compositions are custom formulations with very specific concentration(s) of the active ingredient(s). Each component performs a particular function. For example, aprotic solvents are classified as molecules that do not contain an OeH bond, such as diethyl ether and acetone.  On the other hand, protic solvent molecules contain a H atom attached to an electronegative atom, such as O, with the general formula ROH.  ## 4.3.2.1 Fluoride-Based Chemistry  In Cu interconnect BEOL cleaning applications, aqueous, semiaqueous, and solvent-based strippers containing fluoride were developed for photoresist and dielectric masked PER removal. In recent years, as technology nodes advanced to 65 nm and beyond, the device dimensions became smaller and the etching mask became thinner. At these nodes, TiN (titanium nitride) metal hardmask, as opposed to photoresist and dielectric masks, is used to increase the etching selectivity between the mask and low-k materials. Formulations of various fluoride-based cleaning chemistries are shown in Table 4.3-5.  ## 4.3.2.2 Oxidizing-Based Chemistry  As technology nodes have advanced beyond 45 nm, achieving critical profile control of trenches and vias has become more challenging. A TiN metal hardmask is used to increase RIE selectivity to the underlying low-k materials to achieve better profile control. In addition, undercutting the hardmask can generate voids during subsequent barrier metal, Cu seed layer, and Cu\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: as an introduction to Chapter 6.  ## 1.4.6.3.2 Stripping Of Bulk Photoresist  Photoresists are essentially hydrocarbon polymers composed of a novolack resin, a photoactive compound and an organic solvent. The removal of bulk photoresist patterns is typically accomplished by reaction with atomic oxygen (O), which is created in the plasma environment by dissociation of molecular O2 [221,222]. Basically, two types of plasma reactors can be used to conduct the process both designed for single-wafer processing.  1. A design based on remote or downstream plasma generation 2. A design based on the combination of remote with RF, microwave, or ECR sources for downstream plasma generation with RF-assisted bias.  The preferred method of bulk photoresist stripping after plasma pattern etching or ion implantation now uses downstream reactors, which minimizes ion-induced surface damage while providing good control over reaction parameters with O2 [223]. The stripping rate can often be increased by adding specific gases or vapors to the O2 plasma such as F-containing gases [224], or H2O vapor, which provides additional benefits [225]. Device structures, which cannot withstand oxidation require a nonoxidizing environment. A mixture of typically 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 can then be used as the reactive gas in the plasma cleaning procedure [201].  Patterned photoresist is often used as a mask for the selective implantation of ions. During this process, the surface of the photoresist becomes hardened, making it difficult to remove the used resist layer. Low-energy treatment in an O2 plasma containing an optimally controlled quantity of H2O vapor can remove the resist without damage to the substrate [226].  ## 1.4.6.3.3 Removal Of Etch Residues  Plasma etching used for generating higheaspect ratio Si trenches requires the formation of an etching-resistant sidewall passivation layer to provide protection from lateral etching [227].

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: A detailed study has been made on the removal of sub-monolayer quantities of numerous contaminant metals [220].  Plasma stripping and cleaning. Reactions involved in the removal of bulk photoresist with plasma-generated atomic O were described [221,222], including the use of downstream reactors to minimize ion-induced surface damage [223]. Water vapor addition can be beneficial [225,226] and so is the use of 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 in creating a nonoxidizing environment [201].  The removal of complex etching residues from deep Si trenches [227] using reactive chemical species in a downstream microwave discharge was reported [228]. Metal etch residues with corrosive Cl impurities [222] require the use of in situ H2O-based downstream plasmas followed by wet-chemical cleaning [229]. Removal of etch residues by plasma treatments has been the subject of intensive studies to formulate effective processes. Predeposition cleaning and surface conditioning before gate dielectric formation under optimal conditions and plasma-assisted cleaning before epitaxy are additional critical operations that require carefully optimized procedures [231].  Cryogenic aerosol cleaning and conditioning. This emerging technology has received extensive attention during this period, as evident from the considerable amount of published papers. A theoretical analysis of cryogenic aerosol wafer cleaning has been reported [232]. Nondamaging cryogenic Ar/ N2 aerosols for cleaning IC device wafers with fragile interconnect structures have been used [233,234], including postpatterned BEOL cleaning of wafers with Cu metallization and low-k dielectrics [235]. Cryogenic aerosol processors for the fab are now available [233,234]. SCO2 cleaning has been demonstrated to remove submicron particles and residues from post-CMP treated surfaces more effectively than is resulting from other cleaning processes [240,241]. Organic impurities appear to be removable by a liquid CO2 phase [236e239]. Refined SCO2\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: Vapor-Phase Cleaning Processes  Approaches based on less aggressive chemical reactions with organic chemicals are aimed at the formation of volatilizable compounds, such as metal chelates or nitrosyl compounds. The key requirement for removing trace metal impurities is the formation of volatilizable species by reaction at low temperature to prevent diffusion, followed by their elimination at an elevated temperature at low pressure. Special attention must be paid to the state in which contaminants occur. Elemental metals and other impurities are often present as absorbates or inclusions in the native oxide film rather than being exposed on the semiconductor or oxide surfaces. Etching in HF gas may be necessary to first remove the oxide envelope to render the impurities accessible for chemical attack.  The removal of particles and particulates from wafer surfaces is another difficult problem. A chemical reaction could possibly transform them into volatile species, depending on their composition and size. Vapor etching of an oxide film on which particles are located or in which they are imbedded can be effective if the wafers are positioned vertically and if a vigorous stream of inert gas is applied to sweep the freed particles off the wafer surface.  One of the most frequently used chelating reactant is 1,1,1,5,5,5hexafluoro-2,4-pentanedione, which is used to form volatile metal coordination compounds of Cu [216,217], Fe [217,218], and Na [219]. Copper and iron contaminants are usually present in the form of their various oxides or hydroxides [216e218]. The removal of submonolayer quantities of Cu, Fe, and Na and Ca, K, Li, Ni, and Zn has been studied in detail [220]. Reaction conditions vary widely for different species of impurities and so do the effectiveness for their removal or for the lowering of their surface concentrations, limiting commercial applications for semiconductor device fabrication.  ## 1.4.6.3 Plasma Stripping And Cleaning 1.4.6.3.1 Introduction\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: Many of these cleaning chemistries contain solvents with caustic components that will attack these materials. Since Cu is even more susceptible to corrosion than Al, earlier types of solvent chemistries (including hydroxylamine-based chemistries) have proved to be too aggressive. The wet chemical suppliers have responded by designing compositions with higher H2O content (60e90 wt%). These chemistries can be acidic, mildly basic (pH 7.5w8.5) with an F-based additive, or strongly basic (pH > 11).  Most of the commercially available compositions are custom formulations with very specific concentration(s) of the active ingredient(s). Each component performs a particular function. For example, aprotic solvents are classified as molecules that do not contain an OeH bond, such as diethyl ether and acetone.  On the other hand, protic solvent molecules contain a H atom attached to an electronegative atom, such as O, with the general formula ROH.  ## 4.3.2.1 Fluoride-Based Chemistry  In Cu interconnect BEOL cleaning applications, aqueous, semiaqueous, and solvent-based strippers containing fluoride were developed for photoresist and dielectric masked PER removal. In recent years, as technology nodes advanced to 65 nm and beyond, the device dimensions became smaller and the etching mask became thinner. At these nodes, TiN (titanium nitride) metal hardmask, as opposed to photoresist and dielectric masks, is used to increase the etching selectivity between the mask and low-k materials. Formulations of various fluoride-based cleaning chemistries are shown in Table 4.3-5.  ## 4.3.2.2 Oxidizing-Based Chemistry  As technology nodes have advanced beyond 45 nm, achieving critical profile control of trenches and vias has become more challenging. A TiN metal hardmask is used to increase RIE selectivity to the underlying low-k materials to achieve better profile control. In addition, undercutting the hardmask can generate voids during subsequent barrier metal, Cu seed layer, and Cu\n",

The removal of bulk photoresist patterns is typically accomplished by reaction with atomic oxygen (O), which is created in the plasma environment by dissociation of molecular O2 [221,222]. Basically, two types of plasma reactors can be used to conduct the process both designed for single-wafer processing.  1. A design based on remote or downstream plasma generation 2. A design based on the combination of remote with RF, microwave, or ECR sources for downstream plasma generation with RF-assisted bias.  The preferred method of bulk photoresist stripping after plasma pattern etching or ion implantation now uses downstream reactors, which minimizes ion-induced surface damage while providing good control over reaction parameters with O2 [223]. The stripping rate can often be increased by adding specific gases or vapors to the O2 plasma such as F-containing gases [224], or H2O vapor, which provides additional benefits [225]. Device structures, which cannot withstand oxidation require a nonoxidizing environment. A mixture of typically 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 can then be used as the reactive gas in the plasma cleaning procedure [201].  Patterned photoresist is often used as a mask for the selective implantation of ions. During this process, the surface of the photoresist becomes hardened, making it difficult to remove the used resist layer. Low-energy treatment in an O2 plasma containing an optimally controlled quantity of H2O vapor can remove the resist without damage to the substrate [226].  ## 1.4.6.3.3 Removal Of Etch Residues  Plasma etching used for generating higheaspect ratio Si trenches requires the formation of an etching-resistant sidewall passivation layer to provide protection from lateral etching [227].

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: effect of bromine is based on the fact that CBr4 is not very volatile - it has a boiling point of 190 ∘C. Bromine can also combine with the silicon, which is sputtered from the hardmask, and oxygen to form silicon oxybromides. The passivating effect of sulfur is thought to be caused by the ability of sulfur to form polymers with carbon. The passivation is deposited from the plasma.  In the case of a polysilicon mandrel, typical RIE processes are halogen based. If chlorine or hydrogen bromide gases are used, selectivity to the mask is achieved via plasma deposition of silicon oxychloride and oxybromide reaction products. These compounds also deliver sidewall passivation. For fluorine-based plasma chemistry, fluorocarbon polymer gases are added to provide mask and sidewall passivation by carbon compounds.  The mandrel profiles must be absolutely vertical and without bottom foot. Otherwise, the spacer profiled will be asymmetric and in extreme cases the spacer can topple. Thin yet effective passivation layers such as sulfur or carbon are preferred.  The next step in the SADP flow is spacer deposition, typically by conformal CVD or ALD of SiO2 or Si3N4. TiOx spacers are used in BEOL SADP. Because the outer side of the spacer is formed by deposition, LWR/LER performance is excellent at the outer edge. The inner edge is determined by the mandrel lithography, trim, and etch process. The trim step smoothens the sidewall. Therefore, one of the most outstanding properties of SADP is the excellent high- and medium-frequency LWR/LER performance.  Low-frequency LWR/LER is impacted by potential bending or buckling of the mandrel or the spacer. Both affect the space between the spacers, but not the width of the spacers, which is determined solely by deposition. To leverage this effect, positive and negative spacer schemes have been introduced. The positive tone spacer scheme is used to pattern structures where the width of the line is the critical dimension. Examples are logic\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: supply of fluorine across the fluorocarbon film to the interface and out-diffusion of the etching product (Oehrlein and Lee 1987).  Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001). Figure 7.16 depicts experimental results that were\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: scrubbing either with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) or SC-1 (ammonium hydroxide [NH4OH] and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2] mixture) solution can remove the silica abrasive particles from the oxide surface [26]. Adding megasonic cleaning before brush scrubbing for removing small particles and reducing brush particle loading (significant particle contamination within the brush material) improves the overall particle performance [27]. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), as a result of its SiO2 etching capability, is used to reduce metallic contaminants, by stripping a thin, metal-contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Ideally, HF cleaning is performed after the particle removal with alkaline chemistry in the brush scrubbing step [28]. However, because of brush particle loading in the HF process and the relatively long DIW rinse time required after HF etching processing, HF cleaning is usually conducted before alkaline chemistry brush scrubbing. For advanced nodes, to achieve reduction of Si3N4 loss and minimization of feature topography, slurries with high removal rate selectivity (SiO2 vs. Si3N4) are needed. Therefore, slurries containing CeO2 particles are the preferred oxide CMP slurries [5]. Neither brush scrubbing nor megasonic cleaning with dilute NH4OH or SC-1 can effectively remove CeO2 particles.  HF cleaning in a brush box provides limited capability with respect to removing CeO2 particles, which is achieved by stripping a thin CeO2contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Wafer buffing with water or chemical on a polisher platen or a separate platen is required for more effective CeO2 particle removal.  For high-k metal gate fabrication, the dummy gate-open CMP step includes polishing the SiO2 film with highly selective slurries to stop on the Si3N4 surface [28]. This is followed by polishing of the oxide, nitride, and polySi films with a nonselective slurry to stop on polySi. For this process, the postCMP cleaning step must remove particles and residues from the\n",

IC manufacturers have replaced physical vapor deposition (PVD) Ta with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) Co (cobalt) liners for advanced nodes [168]. The challenge with Co liner is the galvanic corrosion of the Co that occurs when Cu and Co are in contact with one another, which establishes electrical contact in the cleaning solution [169]. Another widely studied liner candidate is ruthenium (Ru) [170]. When Cu and Ru are in electrical contact in the cleaning solution, it is the Cu that is corroded [171]. Wet cleaning formulation manufactures have put considerable effort into developing cleaning solutions to overcome this issue. In addition to these new liner materials, CVD TiN has been considered as a candidate to replace the PVD TaN barrier layer for the metal 1 contact layer. The challenge, in this case, is to have a cleaning solution that removes the PVD TiN mask (about 300 A˚ ) and still is compatible with CVD TiN barrier.  Reducing the etch stop layer thickness is necessary to realize a lower capacitance for BEOL dual Damascene dielectric layers [172]. Compared with conventional SiCN etch stop layers, AlN (aluminum nitride), AlxOy (aluminum oxide), and other Al compounds are attractive because they exhibit a low etching rate with fluorine-containing gas plasma chemistry because of the predominant formation of AlF3, a low-volatility by-product [173,174]. Some IC manufacturers have replaced SiCN with AlN or AlxOy to improve etch selectivity between the low-k and etch-stop layer. There is a problem when using AlN or AlxOy for etch-stop layers in patterned wafers. During low-k etching, the AlN/AlxOy becomes damaged by exposure to fluorine-containing gas plasma and forms AlF3, which is nonvolatile, but water soluble. This poses a serious formulation challenge for wet cleaning manufacturers, because the AlN is removed when it is dissolved in DIW during the\n",

Materials such as Cu (copper) and low-k (dielectric constant) dielectrics, along with small linewidths and high aspect ratios for both Al (aluminum) and Cu feature, require unique cleaning solutions developed specifically for BEOL processing. Depending on the device type (logic, memory, etc.), the types of material (Al or Cu, low-k), the BEOL interconnect scheme, and the number of interconnect layers, there could be as many as 50 BEOL cleaning steps.  ## 4.3.1 Aluminum Interconnect Cleaning  The Al metallization process involves either the subtractive etching of metal to form the metal interconnect lines or etching vias through silica to a previous metal layer. Each etching process generates a different type of PER. After etching the Al metal interconnect, cleaning typically consists of an in situ downstream O2 or H2/O2based plasma step for resist removal, followed by wet chemistry. Although the plasma may remove most, if not all, organic species, a Cl-containing residual film often remains on the sidewall surface.  The addition of a small amount of CF4 to the O2 or H2/O2 plasma can help fluorinate the embedded metallic contamination, rendering the metal complexes more soluble in the subsequent wet cleaning chemistries and DIW rinse. Residual Cl species are a concern because of possible subsequent metal corrosion if they are not removed. Chapter 7 covers plasma stripping and cleaning processes.  Wet cleaning chemical manufacturers are under constant challenges to develop more effective chemical formulations. In the early days of the semiconductor industry it was possible to use phenolic and/or hydrocarbon-based strippers to remove the photoresist [6,7], but in many cases the PER required high bath temperatures (>120C) to remove the residue. As the technologies evolved, newer solvent systems based on N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) or other polar solvents were developed. The\n",

Examples of material used for aqueous processing equipment and components are perfluoroalkoxy (PFA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and oxy-1,4-phenylene-oxy-1,4-phenylenecarbonyl-1,4-phenylene, also known as polyetheretherketone (PEEK). Polyvinylchloride (PVC) has been shown to shed particles and thus is rarely used for aqueous tool components. PEEK is the material that is recommended for DIW transport systems because of its smooth surface properties, lower leaching potential, and temperature insensitivity; however, it is very expensive.  Stainless steel and other metal components must be avoided; stainless steel has the potential to add metallic contaminants into the H2O stream.  ## 4.7.1 Immersion Wet Benches  Batch wet-chemical cleaning systems are either immersion based or spin spray based. Immersion wet stations consist of one or more chemical baths, rinse tanks, and dryers. A wafer cassette is first immersed in the chemical bath for a specified length of time and then transported to the rinse tank. Highproductivity immersion tank systems are fully automated with robotic transfer of the wafer cassettes from the 300-mm front opening unified pod to the carrier used to process the wafers through the system. In some cases, the robot may hold the wafers throughout the entire process with a specially designed arm (\"cassette-less\") or the robot may transfer the wafers to specially designed cassettes that minimize the touch points on the wafer surface, thus minimizing shielding of the wafer surface, the volume of chemical displaced by the cassette, and the amount of chemical carried over to the rinse tank. Materials used for the carrier and the robot must be compatible with all of the chemicals used in the wet bench. Cross-contamination of the robot must be avoided, and thus, most immersion wet bench systems are designed with a robot cleaner.  Immersion baths can reuse the chemical solutions for several\n",

      "Considering the need for precise control of etching rate, Atomic Layer Etching (ALE) might be a suitable option [1]. ALE allows for the precise control of etching rate, which is crucial for achieving the desired precision in pushing the bottom of SiGe and SiP. Additionally, ALE has been used for etching process in semiconductor manufacturing, and its selectivity plays a crucial role in device fabrication.\n",

      "In comparison to other etching processes, ALE offers several advantages. For example, it can provide better uniformity and control over the etching rate, which is critical for achieving the desired precision in pushing the bottom of SiGe and SiP. Furthermore, ALE can be used to etch a wide range of materials, including silicon, germanium, and III-V compounds.\n",

      "On the other hand, Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) with CxFy chemistries is also an important etching application in the semiconductor industry [2]. However, RIE may not provide the same level of precision and control as ALE, especially for high-aspect-ratio structures. Additionally, RIE can be more prone to damage and contamination, which can affect the performance of the device.\n",

      "In conclusion, ALE might be a suitable option for achieving the desired precision in pushing the bottom of SiGe and SiP due to its precise control over etching rate and selectivity.

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Future of plasma etching for microelectronics Challenges Source text: BEOL must deliver on three key metrics, which are typically in competition with each other: yield, reliability, and minimizing the resistance and capacitance (RC) delays. For conventional Cu interconnects, a bilayer liner is deposited onto the etched feature first.  The materials and thicknesses of the liner stack are chosen to obtain an excellent Cu diffusion barrier and adhesion between Cu and the interlayer dielectric (ILD).36 Figure 10(a) shows a sketch of an etched trench into the ILD with a TaN/Co liner bilayer. TaN is typically deposited using physical vapor deposition (PVD) and inherently has a bread loaf shape near the feature opening resulting in a thinner film in those areas that have reduced line of sight to the ionized species. The Co film has high conformality since it is deposited by CVD. The bilayer liner is then followed, all in situ, by a PVD Cu seed film, which also has bread loafs near the opening.  Even with an ideal profile as sketched in Fig. 10(a), it can be challenging for tight pitch configurations to find a process window where the liner and seed films are thick enough on the feature sidewalls while still leaving enough of an opening at the top of the feature to plate through. Figure 10(b) shows a high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image of a 48 nm pitch interconnect where small voids are visible near the sidewalls. The prewet step during Cu plating is designed to first remove the native Cu oxide and will galvanically attack the underlying Co if the original Cu seed is too thin on the sidewall. These Cu voids then result in a fast Cu electromigration path and significantly reduce the interconnect lifetime. It is, therefore, paramount to optimize the plasma etching and produce a feature that is friendly for the PVD processes that follow.  The etched profile gets more complicated in Fig. 11(a), which shows a dual damascene V1/M2 profile landing on M1. The etch stop and hardmask are each depicted\n",

IC manufacturers have replaced physical vapor deposition (PVD) Ta with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) Co (cobalt) liners for advanced nodes [168]. The challenge with Co liner is the galvanic corrosion of the Co that occurs when Cu and Co are in contact with one another, which establishes electrical contact in the cleaning solution [169]. Another widely studied liner candidate is ruthenium (Ru) [170]. When Cu and Ru are in electrical contact in the cleaning solution, it is the Cu that is corroded [171]. Wet cleaning formulation manufactures have put considerable effort into developing cleaning solutions to overcome this issue. In addition to these new liner materials, CVD TiN has been considered as a candidate to replace the PVD TaN barrier layer for the metal 1 contact layer. The challenge, in this case, is to have a cleaning solution that removes the PVD TiN mask (about 300 A˚ ) and still is compatible with CVD TiN barrier.  Reducing the etch stop layer thickness is necessary to realize a lower capacitance for BEOL dual Damascene dielectric layers [172]. Compared with conventional SiCN etch stop layers, AlN (aluminum nitride), AlxOy (aluminum oxide), and other Al compounds are attractive because they exhibit a low etching rate with fluorine-containing gas plasma chemistry because of the predominant formation of AlF3, a low-volatility by-product [173,174]. Some IC manufacturers have replaced SiCN with AlN or AlxOy to improve etch selectivity between the low-k and etch-stop layer. There is a problem when using AlN or AlxOy for etch-stop layers in patterned wafers. During low-k etching, the AlN/AlxOy becomes damaged by exposure to fluorine-containing gas plasma and forms AlF3, which is nonvolatile, but water soluble. This poses a serious formulation challenge for wet cleaning manufacturers, because the AlN is removed when it is dissolved in DIW during the\n",

In the case of fins, the clean immediately following the dry etch that forms the fin is extremely sensitive to damage, because of its thin width and high aspect ratio. Etch residues must be removed without physical damage and the closely spaced features dried without stiction-related collapse. In the case of gate feature patterns, photoresist striping is especially sensitive because of the potential loss of material. After ion implantation with a photoresist mask, a sequence of plasma stripeSPMeSC-1 is typically used to remove the photoresist. This combination leads to: 1. Consumption of Si because of the combination of oxidation and etching.  2. Potential damage to narrow (<2 nm) polySi gate lines from the physical energy used for particle removal.  Silicon consumption, historically, was not a problem, but the number of implantation steps after gate formation has increased as the doping profiles have become shallower; therefore, more Si undesirably is consumed. Of course, SC-1 can be processed at reduced concentration, temperature, and/or time to minimize the consumption, but this can compromise PRE, which also is affected by reducing or eliminating the use of megasonic processing because of pattern damage. Optimization and the development of nondamaging cleaning with megasonic energy or jet spray are being carried out by various research groups.  Logic FEOL integration schemes have demonstrated the use of Ge as a channel material for PMOS (p-channel MOS), because of its high carrier mobility [161]. Currently, SiGe is in production use, with the content of Ge in these films expected to increase until the ultimate limit of pure Ge. Meanwhile, III-V materials have been proposed to realize electron mobility improvement in NMOS (n-channel MOS) [162]. These new materials represent a fundamental shift from the\n",

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

These new materials represent a fundamental shift from the Si-based devices that have dominated the industry for decades. Si readily forms a stable and passivating oxide with a low defect interface; the new materials do not share this property. Materials such as Ge and III-V materials such as GaAs, and InGaAs form oxides that are soluble in water [163]. Therefore, oxidizing solutions such as traditional RCA cleaning processes have much higher etching rates for these materials than they do for Si, and care is required in choosing a cleaning chemistry. For example, Sioncke et al. [163] reported that the traditional 1:1:5 SC-1 solution at 75e80-C etches Si at about 0.82 nm/min, whereas it etches Ge at about 275.5 nm/min and GaAs at 1890 nm/min. They proposed a 1:1:5000 SC1 solution for particle removal, but this presents challenges for process control in a production environment. DeSalvo et al. [164] proposed a two-step process using H2O2 followed by an acidic solution. Such a \"digital etch\" can remove a controlled amount of GaAs (15 A˚ in their study) for each application of the two-step sequence. For InP, acidic H2O2 solutions with well-controlled mix ratios were proposed by van Dorp et al. [165] to enable a small amount of surface etching (e.g., for particle removal) without roughening the InP surface.  ## 4.8.1.2 Memory Technology  DRAM technology currently uses stacked capacitors with increasingly high aspect ratios that present challenges for cleaning and surface preparation. Stacked capacitors in the presence of liquids can collapse because of the surface tension forces, thus making rinsing and drying difficult. In addition, shallow trench isolation (STI) structures feature high aspect ratios and can suffer from stiction while undergoing drying. As these aspect ratios become more severe, even heated IPA and surface modification drying methods are reaching their limit and supercritical CO2-based drying is under consideration, as\n",

For example, in the case of SiGe and SiP, a soft-landing step can be used to clear the majority of the SiGe while leaving a small amount of material on the surface.\n",

      "\n",
      "Selectivity Ratio = (Etch Rate of SiGe) / (Etch Rate of SiP)\n",
      "\n",
      "Using this equation, we can calculate the selectivity ratio for different soft-landing steps and etching conditions. For example, if we use a soft-landing step that results in an etch rate of 2 nm/min for SiGe and 0.5 nm/min for SiP, the selectivity ratio would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "Selectivity Ratio = (2 nm/min) / (0.5 nm/min) = 4\n",

      "This means that the soft-landing step has enhanced the selectivity of the etching process by a factor of 4.\n",

Plasma stripping and cleaning. Reactions involved in the removal of bulk photoresist with plasma-generated atomic O were described [221,222], including the use of downstream reactors to minimize ion-induced surface damage [223]. Water vapor addition can be beneficial [225,226] and so is the use of 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 in creating a nonoxidizing environment [201].  The removal of complex etching residues from deep Si trenches [227] using reactive chemical species in a downstream microwave discharge was reported [228]. Metal etch residues with corrosive Cl impurities [222] require the use of in situ H2O-based downstream plasmas followed by wet-chemical cleaning [229]. Removal of etch residues by plasma treatments has been the subject of intensive studies to formulate effective processes. Predeposition cleaning and surface conditioning before gate dielectric formation under optimal conditions and plasma-assisted cleaning before epitaxy are additional critical operations that require carefully optimized procedures [231].  Cryogenic aerosol cleaning and conditioning. This emerging technology has received extensive attention during this period, as evident from the considerable amount of published papers. A theoretical analysis of cryogenic aerosol wafer cleaning has been reported [232]. Nondamaging cryogenic Ar/ N2 aerosols for cleaning IC device wafers with fragile interconnect structures have been used [233,234], including postpatterned BEOL cleaning of wafers with Cu metallization and low-k dielectrics [235]. Cryogenic aerosol processors for the fab are now available [233,234]. SCO2 cleaning has been demonstrated to remove submicron particles and residues from post-CMP treated surfaces more effectively than is resulting from other cleaning processes [240,241].

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: scrubbing either with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) or SC-1 (ammonium hydroxide [NH4OH] and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2] mixture) solution can remove the silica abrasive particles from the oxide surface [26]. Adding megasonic cleaning before brush scrubbing for removing small particles and reducing brush particle loading (significant particle contamination within the brush material) improves the overall particle performance [27]. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), as a result of its SiO2 etching capability, is used to reduce metallic contaminants, by stripping a thin, metal-contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Ideally, HF cleaning is performed after the particle removal with alkaline chemistry in the brush scrubbing step [28]. However, because of brush particle loading in the HF process and the relatively long DIW rinse time required after HF etching processing, HF cleaning is usually conducted before alkaline chemistry brush scrubbing. For advanced nodes, to achieve reduction of Si3N4 loss and minimization of feature topography, slurries with high removal rate selectivity (SiO2 vs. Si3N4) are needed. Therefore, slurries containing CeO2 particles are the preferred oxide CMP slurries [5]. Neither brush scrubbing nor megasonic cleaning with dilute NH4OH or SC-1 can effectively remove CeO2 particles.  HF cleaning in a brush box provides limited capability with respect to removing CeO2 particles, which is achieved by stripping a thin CeO2contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Wafer buffing with water or chemical on a polisher platen or a separate platen is required for more effective CeO2 particle removal.  For high-k metal gate fabrication, the dummy gate-open CMP step includes polishing the SiO2 film with highly selective slurries to stop on the Si3N4 surface [28]. This is followed by polishing of the oxide, nitride, and polySi films with a nonselective slurry to stop on polySi. For this process, the postCMP cleaning step must remove particles and residues from the\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: Many of these cleaning chemistries contain solvents with caustic components that will attack these materials. Since Cu is even more susceptible to corrosion than Al, earlier types of solvent chemistries (including hydroxylamine-based chemistries) have proved to be too aggressive. The wet chemical suppliers have responded by designing compositions with higher H2O content (60e90 wt%). These chemistries can be acidic, mildly basic (pH 7.5w8.5) with an F-based additive, or strongly basic (pH > 11).  Most of the commercially available compositions are custom formulations with very specific concentration(s) of the active ingredient(s). Each component performs a particular function. For example, aprotic solvents are classified as molecules that do not contain an OeH bond, such as diethyl ether and acetone.  On the other hand, protic solvent molecules contain a H atom attached to an electronegative atom, such as O, with the general formula ROH.  ## 4.3.2.1 Fluoride-Based Chemistry  In Cu interconnect BEOL cleaning applications, aqueous, semiaqueous, and solvent-based strippers containing fluoride were developed for photoresist and dielectric masked PER removal. In recent years, as technology nodes advanced to 65 nm and beyond, the device dimensions became smaller and the etching mask became thinner. At these nodes, TiN (titanium nitride) metal hardmask, as opposed to photoresist and dielectric masks, is used to increase the etching selectivity between the mask and low-k materials. Formulations of various fluoride-based cleaning chemistries are shown in Table 4.3-5.  ## 4.3.2.2 Oxidizing-Based Chemistry  As technology nodes have advanced beyond 45 nm, achieving critical profile control of trenches and vias has become more challenging. A TiN metal hardmask is used to increase RIE selectivity to the underlying low-k materials to achieve better profile control. In addition, undercutting the hardmask can generate voids during subsequent barrier metal, Cu seed layer, and Cu\n",

Bromine can also combine with the silicon, which is sputtered from the hardmask, and oxygen to form silicon oxybromides. The passivating effect of sulfur is thought to be caused by the ability of sulfur to form polymers with carbon. The passivation is deposited from the plasma.  In the case of a polysilicon mandrel, typical RIE processes are halogen based. If chlorine or hydrogen bromide gases are used, selectivity to the mask is achieved via plasma deposition of silicon oxychloride and oxybromide reaction products. These compounds also deliver sidewall passivation. For fluorine-based plasma chemistry, fluorocarbon polymer gases are added to provide mask and sidewall passivation by carbon compounds.  The mandrel profiles must be absolutely vertical and without bottom foot. Otherwise, the spacer profiled will be asymmetric and in extreme cases the spacer can topple. Thin yet effective passivation layers such as sulfur or carbon are preferred.  The next step in the SADP flow is spacer deposition, typically by conformal CVD or ALD of SiO2 or Si3N4. TiOx spacers are used in BEOL SADP. Because the outer side of the spacer is formed by deposition, LWR/LER performance is excellent at the outer edge. The inner edge is determined by the mandrel lithography, trim, and etch process. The trim step smoothens the sidewall. Therefore, one of the most outstanding properties of SADP is the excellent high- and medium-frequency LWR/LER performance.  Low-frequency LWR/LER is impacted by potential bending or buckling of the mandrel or the spacer. Both affect the space between the spacers, but not the width of the spacers, which is determined solely by deposition. To leverage this effect, positive and negative spacer schemes have been introduced. The positive tone spacer scheme is used to pattern structures where the width of the line is the critical dimension. Examples are logic\n",

      "QUESTION: Any suggested step to help debris reduction?\n",
      "\n",
      "ANSWER: Yes, there are several steps that can be taken to help reduce debris in semiconductor manufacturing processes. Here are a few suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Use of megasonic cleaning: Megasonic cleaning is a technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to remove particles and contaminants from surfaces [1].\n",
      "2. Use of cryogenic aerosol cleaning: Cryogenic aerosol cleaning is a technique that uses a cryogenic fluid, such as liquid nitrogen or carbon dioxide, to remove particles and contaminants from surfaces [2].\n",
      "3. Optimization of etching conditions: Optimizing the etching conditions, such as the temperature, pressure, and gas flow rates, can help reduce debris generation during the etching process [3].\n",
      "4. Use of passivation mechanisms: Passivation mechanisms, such as the use of a passivating layer or a sacrificial layer, can help prevent debris from forming on surfaces [4].\n",
      "5. Optimization of maintenance and cleaning conditions: Optimizing the maintenance and cleaning conditions, such as the frequency and duration of cleaning cycles, can help reduce debris generation during the manufacturing process [5].\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing these steps, it is possible to reduce debris generation and improve the overall efficiency of semiconductor manufacturing processes.\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: However, with the implementation of finFET (fin field effect transistor) architectures since the 22-nm node, these fin structures are extremely sensitive.  In the case of fins, the clean immediately following the dry etch that forms the fin is extremely sensitive to damage, because of its thin width and high aspect ratio. Etch residues must be removed without physical damage and the closely spaced features dried without stiction-related collapse. In the case of gate feature patterns, photoresist striping is especially sensitive because of the potential loss of material. After ion implantation with a photoresist mask, a sequence of plasma stripeSPMeSC-1 is typically used to remove the photoresist. This combination leads to: 1. Consumption of Si because of the combination of oxidation and etching.  2. Potential damage to narrow (<2 nm) polySi gate lines from the physical energy used for particle removal.  Silicon consumption, historically, was not a problem, but the number of implantation steps after gate formation has increased as the doping profiles have become shallower; therefore, more Si undesirably is consumed. Of course, SC-1 can be processed at reduced concentration, temperature, and/or time to minimize the consumption, but this can compromise PRE, which also is affected by reducing or eliminating the use of megasonic processing because of pattern damage. Optimization and the development of nondamaging cleaning with megasonic energy or jet spray are being carried out by various research groups.  Logic FEOL integration schemes have demonstrated the use of Ge as a channel material for PMOS (p-channel MOS), because of its high carrier mobility [161]. Currently, SiGe is in production use, with the content of Ge in these films expected to increase until the ultimate limit of pure Ge. Meanwhile, III-V materials have been proposed to realize electron mobility improvement in NMOS (n-channel MOS) [162]. These new materials represent a fundamental shift from the\n",

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001). Figure 7.16 depicts experimental results that were\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Future of plasma etching for microelectronics Challenges Source text: BEOL must deliver on three key metrics, which are typically in competition with each other: yield, reliability, and minimizing the resistance and capacitance (RC) delays. For conventional Cu interconnects, a bilayer liner is deposited onto the etched feature first.  The materials and thicknesses of the liner stack are chosen to obtain an excellent Cu diffusion barrier and adhesion between Cu and the interlayer dielectric (ILD).36 Figure 10(a) shows a sketch of an etched trench into the ILD with a TaN/Co liner bilayer. TaN is typically deposited using physical vapor deposition (PVD) and inherently has a bread loaf shape near the feature opening resulting in a thinner film in those areas that have reduced line of sight to the ionized species. The Co film has high conformality since it is deposited by CVD. The bilayer liner is then followed, all in situ, by a PVD Cu seed film, which also has bread loafs near the opening.  Even with an ideal profile as sketched in Fig. 10(a), it can be challenging for tight pitch configurations to find a process window where the liner and seed films are thick enough on the feature sidewalls while still leaving enough of an opening at the top of the feature to plate through. Figure 10(b) shows a high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image of a 48 nm pitch interconnect where small voids are visible near the sidewalls. The prewet step during Cu plating is designed to first remove the native Cu oxide and will galvanically attack the underlying Co if the original Cu seed is too thin on the sidewall. These Cu voids then result in a fast Cu electromigration path and significantly reduce the interconnect lifetime. It is, therefore, paramount to optimize the plasma etching and produce a feature that is friendly for the PVD processes that follow.  The etched profile gets more complicated in Fig. 11(a), which shows a dual damascene V1/M2 profile landing on M1. The etch stop and hardmask are each depicted\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: A detailed study has been made on the removal of sub-monolayer quantities of numerous contaminant metals [220].  Plasma stripping and cleaning. Reactions involved in the removal of bulk photoresist with plasma-generated atomic O were described [221,222], including the use of downstream reactors to minimize ion-induced surface damage [223]. Water vapor addition can be beneficial [225,226] and so is the use of 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 in creating a nonoxidizing environment [201].  The removal of complex etching residues from deep Si trenches [227] using reactive chemical species in a downstream microwave discharge was reported [228]. Metal etch residues with corrosive Cl impurities [222] require the use of in situ H2O-based downstream plasmas followed by wet-chemical cleaning [229]. Removal of etch residues by plasma treatments has been the subject of intensive studies to formulate effective processes. Predeposition cleaning and surface conditioning before gate dielectric formation under optimal conditions and plasma-assisted cleaning before epitaxy are additional critical operations that require carefully optimized procedures [231].  Cryogenic aerosol cleaning and conditioning. This emerging technology has received extensive attention during this period, as evident from the considerable amount of published papers. A theoretical analysis of cryogenic aerosol wafer cleaning has been reported [232]. Nondamaging cryogenic Ar/ N2 aerosols for cleaning IC device wafers with fragile interconnect structures have been used [233,234], including postpatterned BEOL cleaning of wafers with Cu metallization and low-k dielectrics [235]. Cryogenic aerosol processors for the fab are now available [233,234]. SCO2 cleaning has been demonstrated to remove submicron particles and residues from post-CMP treated surfaces more effectively than is resulting from other cleaning processes [240,241].

In this section, we reviewed the etch innovations introduced to pattern leading edge logic and memory technologies. In logic, we continue to march further down the path of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor scaling and ultimately toward beyond CMOS concepts. The industry is already exploring smaller scaling by stacking n-MOS and p-MOS gate-all-around devices in a selfaligned patterning approach.6 Also, in order to achieve even lower power operations, beyond CMOS concepts are being explored, such as negative capacitance FETs, tunnel FETs and spin-FETs, bringing new types of materials (e.g., 2D materials, multicomponent alloys, superlattices), and architectures for etching.6 Therefore, it is essential to understand processes at the atomic level to achieve the level of precision currently required and this can only be realized by continued close collaboration between industry and academia.  ## B. Direct Print Euv Pattern Transfer Using Plasma Etch For Tight Pitch Metal Layers Hiten Kothari, Steven G. Jaloviar  The adoption of EUV lithography has been introducing new challenges for pattern transfer by plasma etching. We describe the pattern transfer for direct print EUV layers using plasma dry etch for tight pitch metal layers.

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

Adding megasonic cleaning before brush scrubbing for removing small particles and reducing brush particle loading (significant particle contamination within the brush material) improves the overall particle performance [27]. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), as a result of its SiO2 etching capability, is used to reduce metallic contaminants, by stripping a thin, metal-contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Ideally, HF cleaning is performed after the particle removal with alkaline chemistry in the brush scrubbing step [28]. However, because of brush particle loading in the HF process and the relatively long DIW rinse time required after HF etching processing, HF cleaning is usually conducted before alkaline chemistry brush scrubbing. For advanced nodes, to achieve reduction of Si3N4 loss and minimization of feature topography, slurries with high removal rate selectivity (SiO2 vs. Si3N4) are needed. Therefore, slurries containing CeO2 particles are the preferred oxide CMP slurries [5]. Neither brush scrubbing nor megasonic cleaning with dilute NH4OH or SC-1 can effectively remove CeO2 particles.  HF cleaning in a brush box provides limited capability with respect to removing CeO2 particles, which is achieved by stripping a thin CeO2contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Wafer buffing with water or chemical on a polisher platen or a separate platen is required for more effective CeO2 particle removal.  For high-k metal gate fabrication, the dummy gate-open CMP step includes polishing the SiO2 film with highly selective slurries to stop on the Si3N4 surface [28]. This is followed by polishing of the oxide, nitride, and polySi films with a nonselective slurry to stop on polySi. For this process, the postCMP cleaning step must remove particles and residues from the\n",

The removal of bulk photoresist patterns is typically accomplished by reaction with atomic oxygen (O), which is created in the plasma environment by dissociation of molecular O2 [221,222]. Basically, two types of plasma reactors can be used to conduct the process both designed for single-wafer processing.  1. A design based on remote or downstream plasma generation 2. A design based on the combination of remote with RF, microwave, or ECR sources for downstream plasma generation with RF-assisted bias.  The preferred method of bulk photoresist stripping after plasma pattern etching or ion implantation now uses downstream reactors, which minimizes ion-induced surface damage while providing good control over reaction parameters with O2 [223]. The stripping rate can often be increased by adding specific gases or vapors to the O2 plasma such as F-containing gases [224], or H2O vapor, which provides additional benefits [225]. Device structures, which cannot withstand oxidation require a nonoxidizing environment. A mixture of typically 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 can then be used as the reactive gas in the plasma cleaning procedure [201].  Patterned photoresist is often used as a mask for the selective implantation of ions. During this process, the surface of the photoresist becomes hardened, making it difficult to remove the used resist layer. Low-energy treatment in an O2 plasma containing an optimally controlled quantity of H2O vapor can remove the resist without damage to the substrate [226].  ## 1.4.6.3.3 Removal Of Etch Residues  Plasma etching used for generating higheaspect ratio Si trenches requires the formation of an etching-resistant sidewall passivation layer to provide protection from lateral etching [227].

Polymeric/silicate residues, SiO2, and metal oxides in via holes can be removed with anhydrous HF [202]. Anhydrous HF gas with IPA vapor and N2 for SiO2 etching at 150 torr and 50C has been described [203] and HF gas with CH3OH vapor additive [204,205]. Oxide removal with HF/H2O vapor at atmospheric pressure has been used for CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) production [206], for deep submicron n-MOSFET (MOS field effect transistor) cleaning at low pressure [207], and for cluster tool processing [208]. Etching reactions of thermal SiO2 and silicate glass films with HFeH2O vapor at low temperature (40C) and reduced pressure (250 torr) were studied using in situ Fourier transfer infrared analysis [209]. Finally, selective etching of native oxide films can be accomplished with azeotropic HFeH2O and anhydrous HFeIPA [210].  ## 1.4.6.2.2 Ultraviolet/Ozone Cleaning For Removal Of Organics  Short-wave ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the presence of O2 is the oldest of the vapor-phase cleaning methods that has been used successfully for removing organic surface contaminants from many types of surfaces. It is essentially a photosensitized oxidation process. Briefly, many types of organic molecules absorb the short-wavelength UV radiation of 184.9 nm that is generated by low-pressure Hg discharge lamps; this wavelength is also absorbed by the O2 in the ambient air, generating O3. The coproduced 253.7-nm radiation is not absorbed by O2, and hence does not contribute to O3 formation, but it is absorbed by most organic molecules and also by O3. This absorption by O3 is primarily responsible for its destruction so that O3 is continually being formed and destroyed. Atomic oxygen is generated as an intermediate product and its strong oxidation potential allows the reaction with excited or dissociated contaminant molecules, free radicals, and ions. It is probably the main\n",

For example, hydrofluoric acid (HF) is commonly used for SiO2 etching [1], and its concentration can affect the etching rate and selectivity. Additionally, the use of HF with other chemicals such as H2O vapor or F-containing gases can enhance the stripping rate of bulk photoresist [2].

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Future of plasma etching for microelectronics Challenges Source text: BEOL must deliver on three key metrics, which are typically in competition with each other: yield, reliability, and minimizing the resistance and capacitance (RC) delays. For conventional Cu interconnects, a bilayer liner is deposited onto the etched feature first.  The materials and thicknesses of the liner stack are chosen to obtain an excellent Cu diffusion barrier and adhesion between Cu and the interlayer dielectric (ILD).36 Figure 10(a) shows a sketch of an etched trench into the ILD with a TaN/Co liner bilayer. TaN is typically deposited using physical vapor deposition (PVD) and inherently has a bread loaf shape near the feature opening resulting in a thinner film in those areas that have reduced line of sight to the ionized species. The Co film has high conformality since it is deposited by CVD. The bilayer liner is then followed, all in situ, by a PVD Cu seed film, which also has bread loafs near the opening.  Even with an ideal profile as sketched in Fig. 10(a), it can be challenging for tight pitch configurations to find a process window where the liner and seed films are thick enough on the feature sidewalls while still leaving enough of an opening at the top of the feature to plate through. Figure 10(b) shows a high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image of a 48 nm pitch interconnect where small voids are visible near the sidewalls. The prewet step during Cu plating is designed to first remove the native Cu oxide and will galvanically attack the underlying Co if the original Cu seed is too thin on the sidewall. These Cu voids then result in a fast Cu electromigration path and significantly reduce the interconnect lifetime. It is, therefore, paramount to optimize the plasma etching and produce a feature that is friendly for the PVD processes that follow.  The etched profile gets more complicated in Fig. 11(a), which shows a dual damascene V1/M2 profile landing on M1. The etch stop and hardmask are each depicted\n",

In the case of fins, the clean immediately following the dry etch that forms the fin is extremely sensitive to damage, because of its thin width and high aspect ratio. Etch residues must be removed without physical damage and the closely spaced features dried without stiction-related collapse. In the case of gate feature patterns, photoresist striping is especially sensitive because of the potential loss of material. After ion implantation with a photoresist mask, a sequence of plasma stripeSPMeSC-1 is typically used to remove the photoresist. This combination leads to: 1. Consumption of Si because of the combination of oxidation and etching.  2. Potential damage to narrow (<2 nm) polySi gate lines from the physical energy used for particle removal.  Silicon consumption, historically, was not a problem, but the number of implantation steps after gate formation has increased as the doping profiles have become shallower; therefore, more Si undesirably is consumed. Of course, SC-1 can be processed at reduced concentration, temperature, and/or time to minimize the consumption, but this can compromise PRE, which also is affected by reducing or eliminating the use of megasonic processing because of pattern damage. Optimization and the development of nondamaging cleaning with megasonic energy or jet spray are being carried out by various research groups.  Logic FEOL integration schemes have demonstrated the use of Ge as a channel material for PMOS (p-channel MOS), because of its high carrier mobility [161].

To mitigate magnetically induced drifts, industrial MERIE tools were designed with oscillatory magnetic fields, such as rotating magnets on Tokyo Electron's Dynamic Resource Management (TEL DRM) chamber.198 In the past decade or so, MERIE has faded away, mostly because the shrink of CD renders μm/min ER unnecessary. However, an external magnetic field brings one more degree of freedom into controlling the plasma, and this concept could be \"recycled\" and reapplied for uniformity and profile control in future applications.  The challenges in industrial plasma etch originate from scaling (see Fig. 24). First, for X-Y (planar) scaling, plasma-based patterning development is dominated by the adoption of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and overlays.199 It has been reported there is a triangular trade-off relationship among resolution, exposure dose, and defect control in EUV lithography.200 One of the three must be sacrificed if the other two are defined. Due to the optical constraint of EUV lithography and low dose requirement for throughput, plasma etch is asked to mitigate defects originating from EUV patterning, such as LER and stochastics-printing errors (scum, breakage).201,202 Promising technology includes resist hardening by energetic or reactive species from plasma,203 printing error repair by plasma-based deposition-trimming cycles,204 and direct scum removal using energetic species.201 Furthermore, the recent progress on metal compound EUV photoresists,205 with their promising improvement on sensitivity and resolution, also demands for innovative plasma etch processes.206 Second, for Z (vertical) scaling, the arrival of 3D device architectures\n",

In this section, we reviewed the etch innovations introduced to pattern leading edge logic and memory technologies. In logic, we continue to march further down the path of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor scaling and ultimately toward beyond CMOS concepts. The industry is already exploring smaller scaling by stacking n-MOS and p-MOS gate-all-around devices in a selfaligned patterning approach.6 Also, in order to achieve even lower power operations, beyond CMOS concepts are being explored, such as negative capacitance FETs, tunnel FETs and spin-FETs, bringing new types of materials (e.g., 2D materials, multicomponent alloys, superlattices), and architectures for etching.6 Therefore, it is essential to understand processes at the atomic level to achieve the level of precision currently required and this can only be realized by continued close collaboration between industry and academia.  ## B.

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Future of plasma etching for microelectronics Challenges Source text: BEOL must deliver on three key metrics, which are typically in competition with each other: yield, reliability, and minimizing the resistance and capacitance (RC) delays. For conventional Cu interconnects, a bilayer liner is deposited onto the etched feature first.  The materials and thicknesses of the liner stack are chosen to obtain an excellent Cu diffusion barrier and adhesion between Cu and the interlayer dielectric (ILD).36 Figure 10(a) shows a sketch of an etched trench into the ILD with a TaN/Co liner bilayer. TaN is typically deposited using physical vapor deposition (PVD) and inherently has a bread loaf shape near the feature opening resulting in a thinner film in those areas that have reduced line of sight to the ionized species. The Co film has high conformality since it is deposited by CVD. The bilayer liner is then followed, all in situ, by a PVD Cu seed film, which also has bread loafs near the opening.  Even with an ideal profile as sketched in Fig. 10(a), it can be challenging for tight pitch configurations to find a process window where the liner and seed films are thick enough on the feature sidewalls while still leaving enough of an opening at the top of the feature to plate through. Figure 10(b) shows a high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image of a 48 nm pitch interconnect where small voids are visible near the sidewalls. The prewet step during Cu plating is designed to first remove the native Cu oxide and will galvanically attack the underlying Co if the original Cu seed is too thin on the sidewall. These Cu voids then result in a fast Cu electromigration path and significantly reduce the interconnect lifetime. It is, therefore, paramount to optimize the plasma etching and produce a feature that is friendly for the PVD processes that follow.  The etched profile gets more complicated in Fig. 11(a), which shows a dual damascene V1/M2 profile landing on M1. The etch stop and hardmask are each depicted\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: Many of these cleaning chemistries contain solvents with caustic components that will attack these materials. Since Cu is even more susceptible to corrosion than Al, earlier types of solvent chemistries (including hydroxylamine-based chemistries) have proved to be too aggressive. The wet chemical suppliers have responded by designing compositions with higher H2O content (60e90 wt%). These chemistries can be acidic, mildly basic (pH 7.5w8.5) with an F-based additive, or strongly basic (pH > 11).  Most of the commercially available compositions are custom formulations with very specific concentration(s) of the active ingredient(s). Each component performs a particular function. For example, aprotic solvents are classified as molecules that do not contain an OeH bond, such as diethyl ether and acetone.  On the other hand, protic solvent molecules contain a H atom attached to an electronegative atom, such as O, with the general formula ROH.  ## 4.3.2.1 Fluoride-Based Chemistry  In Cu interconnect BEOL cleaning applications, aqueous, semiaqueous, and solvent-based strippers containing fluoride were developed for photoresist and dielectric masked PER removal. In recent years, as technology nodes advanced to 65 nm and beyond, the device dimensions became smaller and the etching mask became thinner. At these nodes, TiN (titanium nitride) metal hardmask, as opposed to photoresist and dielectric masks, is used to increase the etching selectivity between the mask and low-k materials. Formulations of various fluoride-based cleaning chemistries are shown in Table 4.3-5.  ## 4.3.2.2 Oxidizing-Based Chemistry  As technology nodes have advanced beyond 45 nm, achieving critical profile control of trenches and vias has become more challenging. A TiN metal hardmask is used to increase RIE selectivity to the underlying low-k materials to achieve better profile control. In addition, undercutting the hardmask can generate voids during subsequent barrier metal, Cu seed layer, and Cu\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: However, with the implementation of finFET (fin field effect transistor) architectures since the 22-nm node, these fin structures are extremely sensitive.  In the case of fins, the clean immediately following the dry etch that forms the fin is extremely sensitive to damage, because of its thin width and high aspect ratio. Etch residues must be removed without physical damage and the closely spaced features dried without stiction-related collapse. In the case of gate feature patterns, photoresist striping is especially sensitive because of the potential loss of material. After ion implantation with a photoresist mask, a sequence of plasma stripeSPMeSC-1 is typically used to remove the photoresist. This combination leads to: 1. Consumption of Si because of the combination of oxidation and etching.  2. Potential damage to narrow (<2 nm) polySi gate lines from the physical energy used for particle removal.  Silicon consumption, historically, was not a problem, but the number of implantation steps after gate formation has increased as the doping profiles have become shallower; therefore, more Si undesirably is consumed. Of course, SC-1 can be processed at reduced concentration, temperature, and/or time to minimize the consumption, but this can compromise PRE, which also is affected by reducing or eliminating the use of megasonic processing because of pattern damage. Optimization and the development of nondamaging cleaning with megasonic energy or jet spray are being carried out by various research groups.  Logic FEOL integration schemes have demonstrated the use of Ge as a channel material for PMOS (p-channel MOS), because of its high carrier mobility [161]. Currently, SiGe is in production use, with the content of Ge in these films expected to increase until the ultimate limit of pure Ge. Meanwhile, III-V materials have been proposed to realize electron mobility improvement in NMOS (n-channel MOS) [162]. These new materials represent a fundamental shift from the\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: A detailed study has been made on the removal of sub-monolayer quantities of numerous contaminant metals [220].  Plasma stripping and cleaning. Reactions involved in the removal of bulk photoresist with plasma-generated atomic O were described [221,222], including the use of downstream reactors to minimize ion-induced surface damage [223]. Water vapor addition can be beneficial [225,226] and so is the use of 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 in creating a nonoxidizing environment [201].  The removal of complex etching residues from deep Si trenches [227] using reactive chemical species in a downstream microwave discharge was reported [228]. Metal etch residues with corrosive Cl impurities [222] require the use of in situ H2O-based downstream plasmas followed by wet-chemical cleaning [229]. Removal of etch residues by plasma treatments has been the subject of intensive studies to formulate effective processes. Predeposition cleaning and surface conditioning before gate dielectric formation under optimal conditions and plasma-assisted cleaning before epitaxy are additional critical operations that require carefully optimized procedures [231].  Cryogenic aerosol cleaning and conditioning. This emerging technology has received extensive attention during this period, as evident from the considerable amount of published papers. A theoretical analysis of cryogenic aerosol wafer cleaning has been reported [232]. Nondamaging cryogenic Ar/ N2 aerosols for cleaning IC device wafers with fragile interconnect structures have been used [233,234], including postpatterned BEOL cleaning of wafers with Cu metallization and low-k dielectrics [235]. Cryogenic aerosol processors for the fab are now available [233,234]. SCO2 cleaning has been demonstrated to remove submicron particles and residues from post-CMP treated surfaces more effectively than is resulting from other cleaning processes [240,241]. Organic impurities appear to be removable by a liquid CO2 phase [236e239]. Refined SCO2\n",

Materials such as Cu (copper) and low-k (dielectric constant) dielectrics, along with small linewidths and high aspect ratios for both Al (aluminum) and Cu feature, require unique cleaning solutions developed specifically for BEOL processing. Depending on the device type (logic, memory, etc.), the types of material (Al or Cu, low-k), the BEOL interconnect scheme, and the number of interconnect layers, there could be as many as 50 BEOL cleaning steps.  ## 4.3.1 Aluminum Interconnect Cleaning  The Al metallization process involves either the subtractive etching of metal to form the metal interconnect lines or etching vias through silica to a previous metal layer. Each etching process generates a different type of PER. After etching the Al metal interconnect, cleaning typically consists of an in situ downstream O2 or H2/O2based plasma step for resist removal, followed by wet chemistry. Although the plasma may remove most, if not all, organic species, a Cl-containing residual film often remains on the sidewall surface.  The addition of a small amount of CF4 to the O2 or H2/O2 plasma can help fluorinate the embedded metallic contamination, rendering the metal complexes more soluble in the subsequent wet cleaning chemistries and DIW rinse. Residual Cl species are a concern because of possible subsequent metal corrosion if they are not removed. Chapter 7 covers plasma stripping and cleaning processes.  Wet cleaning chemical manufacturers are under constant challenges to develop more effective chemical formulations. In the early days of the semiconductor industry it was possible to use phenolic and/or hydrocarbon-based strippers to remove the photoresist [6,7], but in many cases the PER required high bath temperatures (>120C) to remove the residue. As the technologies evolved, newer solvent systems based on N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) or other polar solvents were developed. The\n",

      "\n",
      "Iso-dense CD loading is a critical issue in silicon etching, particularly as scaling increases. To address this challenge, it's essential to understand the current etching techniques being used and how they can be optimized for reduced iso-dense CD loading.\n",

      "\n",
      "The impact of aspect ratios on the etching process is significant, particularly in high-aspect-ratio structures such as those found in finFET architectures [3].

Polymeric/silicate residues, SiO2, and metal oxides in via holes can be removed with anhydrous HF [202]. Anhydrous HF gas with IPA vapor and N2 for SiO2 etching at 150 torr and 50C has been described [203] and HF gas with CH3OH vapor additive [204,205]. Oxide removal with HF/H2O vapor at atmospheric pressure has been used for CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) production [206], for deep submicron n-MOSFET (MOS field effect transistor) cleaning at low pressure [207], and for cluster tool processing [208]. Etching reactions of thermal SiO2 and silicate glass films with HFeH2O vapor at low temperature (40C) and reduced pressure (250 torr) were studied using in situ Fourier transfer infrared analysis [209]. Finally, selective etching of native oxide films can be accomplished with azeotropic HFeH2O and anhydrous HFeIPA [210].  ## 1.4.6.2.2 Ultraviolet/Ozone Cleaning For Removal Of Organics  Short-wave ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the presence of O2 is the oldest of the vapor-phase cleaning methods that has been used successfully for removing organic surface contaminants from many types of surfaces. It is essentially a photosensitized oxidation process. Briefly, many types of organic molecules absorb the short-wavelength UV radiation of 184.9 nm that is generated by low-pressure Hg discharge lamps; this wavelength is also absorbed by the O2 in the ambient air, generating O3. The coproduced 253.7-nm radiation is not absorbed by O2, and hence does not contribute to O3 formation, but it is absorbed by most organic molecules and also by O3. This absorption by O3 is primarily responsible for its destruction so that O3 is continually being formed and destroyed. Atomic oxygen is generated as an intermediate product and its strong oxidation potential allows the reaction with excited or dissociated contaminant molecules, free radicals, and ions. It is probably the main\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: scrubbing either with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) or SC-1 (ammonium hydroxide [NH4OH] and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2] mixture) solution can remove the silica abrasive particles from the oxide surface [26]. Adding megasonic cleaning before brush scrubbing for removing small particles and reducing brush particle loading (significant particle contamination within the brush material) improves the overall particle performance [27]. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), as a result of its SiO2 etching capability, is used to reduce metallic contaminants, by stripping a thin, metal-contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Ideally, HF cleaning is performed after the particle removal with alkaline chemistry in the brush scrubbing step [28]. However, because of brush particle loading in the HF process and the relatively long DIW rinse time required after HF etching processing, HF cleaning is usually conducted before alkaline chemistry brush scrubbing. For advanced nodes, to achieve reduction of Si3N4 loss and minimization of feature topography, slurries with high removal rate selectivity (SiO2 vs. Si3N4) are needed. Therefore, slurries containing CeO2 particles are the preferred oxide CMP slurries [5]. Neither brush scrubbing nor megasonic cleaning with dilute NH4OH or SC-1 can effectively remove CeO2 particles.  HF cleaning in a brush box provides limited capability with respect to removing CeO2 particles, which is achieved by stripping a thin CeO2contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Wafer buffing with water or chemical on a polisher platen or a separate platen is required for more effective CeO2 particle removal.  For high-k metal gate fabrication, the dummy gate-open CMP step includes polishing the SiO2 film with highly selective slurries to stop on the Si3N4 surface [28]. This is followed by polishing of the oxide, nitride, and polySi films with a nonselective slurry to stop on polySi. For this process, the postCMP cleaning step must remove particles and residues from the\n",

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

The process consists of two consecutively applied hot solutions known as \"RCA Standard Clean,\" SC-1 and SC-2, featuring pure and volatile reagents. These solutions have been widely used in their original or modified form for over 40 years in the fabrication of Si semiconductor devices.  The SC-1 solution for the first processing step consists of a mixture of NH4OH (ammonium hydroxide), H2O2, and H2O, also known as \"ammoniaeperoxide mixture. The SC-2 solution for the second processing step consists of a mixture of HCl (hydrochloric acid), H2O2, and H2O, also known as \"hydrochloriceperoxide mixture.\" The process as originally published [101] is concisely described below. Changed or modified versions of the RCA clean as they are used now will be discussed in the next section.  The originally specified composition for the SC-1 solution ranges from 5:1:1 to 7:2:1 parts by volume of H2O:H2O2:NH4OH. Filtered DIW or quartzdistilled H2O is used. The H2O2 is electronic grade 30 wt% H2O2, unstabilized (to exclude contaminating stabilizers). The NH4OH is 27% (wt/wt% based on NH3). The originally specified composition for the SC-2 solution ranges from 6:1:1 to 8:2:1 parts by volume of H2O:H2O2:HCl; the H2O and H2O2 are as noted above. The HCl concentration is 37 wt%.  The exact compositions for both solutions are not critical for proper performance; the recommended proportions are reliable and simple to prepare and use. Cleaning in either mixture is carried out at 75e85C for 10e20 min followed by a quench and overflow rinse in running DIW. Diluting the hot bath solutions with cold H2O is done to displace the surface level of the liquid and to reduce the bath temperature to prevent any drying of the wafers on withdrawal from the bath. The wafers are rinsed with running DIW or quartzdistilled H2O and then spun dry. They are immediately transferred to an enclosure flushed with\n",

These new materials represent a fundamental shift from the Si-based devices that have dominated the industry for decades. Si readily forms a stable and passivating oxide with a low defect interface; the new materials do not share this property. Materials such as Ge and III-V materials such as GaAs, and InGaAs form oxides that are soluble in water [163]. Therefore, oxidizing solutions such as traditional RCA cleaning processes have much higher etching rates for these materials than they do for Si, and care is required in choosing a cleaning chemistry. For example, Sioncke et al. [163] reported that the traditional 1:1:5 SC-1 solution at 75e80-C etches Si at about 0.82 nm/min, whereas it etches Ge at about 275.5 nm/min and GaAs at 1890 nm/min. They proposed a 1:1:5000 SC1 solution for particle removal, but this presents challenges for process control in a production environment. DeSalvo et al. [164] proposed a two-step process using H2O2 followed by an acidic solution. Such a \"digital etch\" can remove a controlled amount of GaAs (15 A˚ in their study) for each application of the two-step sequence. For InP, acidic H2O2 solutions with well-controlled mix ratios were proposed by van Dorp et al. [165] to enable a small amount of surface etching (e.g., for particle removal) without roughening the InP surface.  ## 4.8.1.2 Memory Technology  DRAM technology currently uses stacked capacitors with increasingly high aspect ratios that present challenges for cleaning and surface preparation. Stacked capacitors in the presence of liquids can collapse because of the surface tension forces, thus making rinsing and drying difficult. In addition, shallow trench isolation (STI) structures feature high aspect ratios and can suffer from stiction while undergoing drying. As these aspect ratios become more severe, even heated IPA and surface modification drying methods are reaching their limit and supercritical CO2-based drying is under consideration, as\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: thermal energy of photons, and electrons. Even the mechanical energy of the tip of an atomic force microscope has been reported to induce the etching of a chemically modified surface (Chen et al. 2018).  In this framework for etching, one or more fluxes of particles and energy sources interact with the surface simultaneously or in sequence to modify the surface and to break bonds of the material to be removed. Depending on what particles and energy sources are used and whether they interact with the surface simultaneously or in sequence, dry etching technologies can be classified into thermal etching, thermal isotropic atomic layer etching (ALE), radical etching, directional or ion-assisted ALE, reactive ion etching (RIE), and ion beam etching (IBE). We will introduce a classification of etching technologies in Section 2.9.  Etching processes of semiconductor devices form 3D structures that can consist of several different materials. Extensive, application-specific tables of requirements must be met when etching advanced semiconductor devices. Here is a list of common important etching requirements.  ## 2.1.1 Etching Rate (Er)  This is the most important etching performance parameter. It is expressed as the change in thickness of the etching film as a function of time and is usually measured in nm/min. For a sputtering process, this rate can also be expressed as a function of the sputtering yield G, which is the ratio of ejected atoms and ions to impinging ions.  For chemically enhanced processes such as RIE, the dependence of the etching rate (ER) on the incoming fluxes is much more complex (see Section 7.1).  For ALE, the term etching rate is replaced by the term \"etching per cycle\" (EPC) expressed in nm or Å because the process is cyclic and removes a well-defined amount of material every cycle. This approach is analogous to the nomenclature in thin film deposition where continuous technologies such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are characterized by a\n",

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

Bromine can also combine with the silicon, which is sputtered from the hardmask, and oxygen to form silicon oxybromides. The passivating effect of sulfur is thought to be caused by the ability of sulfur to form polymers with carbon. The passivation is deposited from the plasma.  In the case of a polysilicon mandrel, typical RIE processes are halogen based. If chlorine or hydrogen bromide gases are used, selectivity to the mask is achieved via plasma deposition of silicon oxychloride and oxybromide reaction products. These compounds also deliver sidewall passivation. For fluorine-based plasma chemistry, fluorocarbon polymer gases are added to provide mask and sidewall passivation by carbon compounds.  The mandrel profiles must be absolutely vertical and without bottom foot. Otherwise, the spacer profiled will be asymmetric and in extreme cases the spacer can topple. Thin yet effective passivation layers such as sulfur or carbon are preferred.  The next step in the SADP flow is spacer deposition, typically by conformal CVD or ALD of SiO2 or Si3N4. TiOx spacers are used in BEOL SADP. Because the outer side of the spacer is formed by deposition, LWR/LER performance is excellent at the outer edge. The inner edge is determined by the mandrel lithography, trim, and etch process. The trim step smoothens the sidewall. Therefore, one of the most outstanding properties of SADP is the excellent high- and medium-frequency LWR/LER performance.  Low-frequency LWR/LER is impacted by potential bending or buckling of the mandrel or the spacer. Both affect the space between the spacers, but not the width of the spacers, which is determined solely by deposition. To leverage this effect, positive and negative spacer schemes have been introduced. The positive tone spacer scheme is used to pattern structures where the width of the line is the critical dimension. Examples are logic\n",

Modeling of high aspect ratio etching of SiO2 has shown that chemically enhanced sputtering plays a very important role beyond aspect ratios of 10 : 1 (Huang et al. 2019).  Tachi et al. measured chemical sputtering yields of silicon under bombardment by mass-selected reactive F+, Cl+, and Br+ ions as well as nonreactive Ne+, Ar+, and Kr+ ions (Tachi and Okudaira 1986). Since ions with nearly equal mass were compared, there should no difference in the sputtering yield because the sputtering yield is dependent on the mass and energy of the impinging ion (see  ![148_image_0.png](148_image_0.png)  Eq. (2.8)). However, the experimental results in Figure 7.2 show that in comparison with their nonreactive neighbors in the periodic table, the sputtering yields for the reactive ions were higher. The chemistry effect is larger for chlorine than fluorine and nearly absent for bromine. The effect is also more pronounced for lower ion energies. These results can be explained by implantation of halogen ions and the formation of strong bonds with silicon. This will lower the binding energy EO of the modified layer and lead to higher sputtering yields (see Eq. (2.8)).  This effect has been called chemical sputtering (Tachi and Okudaira 1986).  The term \"*chemical sputtering*\" has also been applied to the enhancement of the sputtering yield by the presence of halogens and other reactive species due to adsorption (Coburn 1994a). In the light of recent developments in directional ALE, we will use the term \"*chemical sputtering*\" to describe strictly the effect of reactive ions. This effect is present in RIE and RIBE but not in directional ALE.  Here, noble gas ions are used in the removal step. This mechanism can be best described as physical sputtering of a chemically weakened surface or\n",
      "Relationships of the knowledge: reactive ions increases sputtering yield. fluorine radicals exhibits smaller chemical sputtering effect than chlorine radicals. fluorine radicals contribute to etching process. bromine ions has negligible chemical sputtering. bromine ions has lower reflection probability than,has narrower distribution of reflected angles than,experiences larger kinetic energy loss than chlorine radicals. etching process involves physical sputtering. halogen atoms forms strong bonds with surface layer. reactive ion beam etching (ribe) significantly affected by chemical sputtering. reactive ion beam etching (ribe) employs to modify surface reactive ions. chemical sputtering enhances etching process. chemical sputtering differs from physical sputtering. ./paper/atomic layer processing_semiconductor/104_image_1.png depicts sputtering yield of reactive ions. Here is information from the figure: The image shows a graph depicting the etch rate of silicon (Si) over time under different conditions. The x-axis represents time in seconds (s), ranging from 0 to 900 seconds. The y-axis represents the etch rate in Åmin^-1, ranging from 0 to 70 Åmin^-1.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three distinct phases in the graph:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The initial phase (0 to approximately 200 seconds) shows a high etch rate, starting at around 60 Åmin^-1 and decreasing to about 20 Åmin^-1. This phase is labeled \"XeF2 gas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The middle phase (approximately 200 to 600 seconds) shows a relatively stable etch rate, maintaining around 20 Åmin^-1. This phase is labeled \"Ar+ ion beam + XeF2 gas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The final phase (approximately 600 to 900 seconds) shows a low etch rate, starting at around 20 Åmin^-1 and decreasing to about 10 Åmin^-1. This phase is labeled \"Ar+ ion beam.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The graph indicates that the etch rate of silicon is highest when exposed to XeF2 gas, decreases to a stable rate when exposed to an Ar+ ion beam combined with XeF2 gas, and further decreases when exposed to an Ar+ ion beam alone. This suggests that the presence of XeF2 gas significantly enhances the etching process, while the Ar+ ion beam alone has a lesser effect.\n",

      "QUESTION: How does the binding energy of tungsten influence the sputtering yield and etching rate in this process?\n",
      "\n",
      "ANSWER: The binding energy of tungsten influences the sputtering yield and etching rate by affecting the ease with which atoms can be removed from the surface. A lower binding energy means that less energy is required to remove an atom, resulting in a higher sputtering yield and etching rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Eq. (2.8) [1], the sputtering yield is dependent on the mass and energy of the impinging ion, as well as the binding energy of the surface atoms. If the binding energy is lowered due to chemical reactions or other mechanisms, the sputtering yield can increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of tungsten, its high binding energy makes it more resistant to sputtering and etching. However, if reactive ions such as fluorine or chlorine are present, they can form strong bonds with the tungsten surface atoms, lowering their binding energy and increasing the sputtering yield [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the binding energy of tungsten plays a crucial role in determining the sputtering yield and etching rate in this process. By understanding how to manipulate the binding energy through chemical reactions or other mechanisms, it may be possible to optimize the etching process for improved performance.\n",

Polymeric/silicate residues, SiO2, and metal oxides in via holes can be removed with anhydrous HF [202]. Anhydrous HF gas with IPA vapor and N2 for SiO2 etching at 150 torr and 50C has been described [203] and HF gas with CH3OH vapor additive [204,205]. Oxide removal with HF/H2O vapor at atmospheric pressure has been used for CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) production [206], for deep submicron n-MOSFET (MOS field effect transistor) cleaning at low pressure [207], and for cluster tool processing [208]. Etching reactions of thermal SiO2 and silicate glass films with HFeH2O vapor at low temperature (40C) and reduced pressure (250 torr) were studied using in situ Fourier transfer infrared analysis [209]. Finally, selective etching of native oxide films can be accomplished with azeotropic HFeH2O and anhydrous HFeIPA [210].  ## 1.4.6.2.2 Ultraviolet/Ozone Cleaning For Removal Of Organics  Short-wave ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the presence of O2 is the oldest of the vapor-phase cleaning methods that has been used successfully for removing organic surface contaminants from many types of surfaces. It is essentially a photosensitized oxidation process. Briefly, many types of organic molecules absorb the short-wavelength UV radiation of 184.9 nm that is generated by low-pressure Hg discharge lamps; this wavelength is also absorbed by the O2 in the ambient air, generating O3. The coproduced 253.7-nm radiation is not absorbed by O2, and hence does not contribute to O3 formation, but it is absorbed by most organic molecules and also by O3. This absorption by O3 is primarily responsible for its destruction so that O3 is continually being formed and destroyed. Atomic oxygen is generated as an intermediate product and its strong oxidation potential allows the reaction with excited or dissociated contaminant molecules, free radicals, and ions. It is probably the main\n",

Plasma stripping and cleaning. Reactions involved in the removal of bulk photoresist with plasma-generated atomic O were described [221,222], including the use of downstream reactors to minimize ion-induced surface damage [223]. Water vapor addition can be beneficial [225,226] and so is the use of 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 in creating a nonoxidizing environment [201].  The removal of complex etching residues from deep Si trenches [227] using reactive chemical species in a downstream microwave discharge was reported [228]. Metal etch residues with corrosive Cl impurities [222] require the use of in situ H2O-based downstream plasmas followed by wet-chemical cleaning [229]. Removal of etch residues by plasma treatments has been the subject of intensive studies to formulate effective processes. Predeposition cleaning and surface conditioning before gate dielectric formation under optimal conditions and plasma-assisted cleaning before epitaxy are additional critical operations that require carefully optimized procedures [231].  Cryogenic aerosol cleaning and conditioning. This emerging technology has received extensive attention during this period, as evident from the considerable amount of published papers. A theoretical analysis of cryogenic aerosol wafer cleaning has been reported [232]. Nondamaging cryogenic Ar/ N2 aerosols for cleaning IC device wafers with fragile interconnect structures have been used [233,234], including postpatterned BEOL cleaning of wafers with Cu metallization and low-k dielectrics [235]. Cryogenic aerosol processors for the fab are now available [233,234]. SCO2 cleaning has been demonstrated to remove submicron particles and residues from post-CMP treated surfaces more effectively than is resulting from other cleaning processes [240,241].

The organic material can be effectively removed using plasma processes. Depending on the wavelength used for lithography, various additives and solvents are incorporated into the photoresist formulation; for instance, PACs such as diazo-based materials and photoacid generators such as onium salts are typically used. Fortunately, most of these additives are easily stripped in both oxidizing and reducing chemistries.  The stripping and cleaning processes require high-purity gases; typically, 99.9999% purity is used. In-line purifiers have been employed to further reduce unwanted background contamination, although oxidizing plasma stripping processes have a high tolerance for contaminants such as H2O and H2. Reducing processes are also forgiving. However, for Si wafer conditioning, reducing chemistries that contain H2O and O2 are easily plasma activated and can oxidize sample surfaces. Most IC manufacturers rely on bulk delivery of gases with appropriate filters and purifiers. Mass flow controllers are used to monitor and deliver precise quantities of gases into the reaction chamber.  Oxidizing Chemistries: Oxidizing chemistries are typically composed of O2 plus a carrier gas and additives. The oxidizing species can be O2, H2O, or N2O or other gases containing an O atom. Because photoresist is composed of hydrocarbons, the O2 plasmas generate O, which easily reacts with this film to form volatile byproducts:  $${\\bf C}_{n}{\\bf H}_{m}+\\left(n+\\frac{m}{2}\\right){\\bf O}_{2}\\!\\rightarrow\\!n\\;{\\bf CO}_{2}+\\frac{m}{2}\\;{\\bf H}_{2}{\\bf O}.$$ (7.3-1) Small amounts of N2 (3e5 vol%) have been shown to promote dissociation of O2 to increase the stripping rate [138,142], whereas adding more N2 decreases the etching rate.

Adding megasonic cleaning before brush scrubbing for removing small particles and reducing brush particle loading (significant particle contamination within the brush material) improves the overall particle performance [27]. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), as a result of its SiO2 etching capability, is used to reduce metallic contaminants, by stripping a thin, metal-contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Ideally, HF cleaning is performed after the particle removal with alkaline chemistry in the brush scrubbing step [28]. However, because of brush particle loading in the HF process and the relatively long DIW rinse time required after HF etching processing, HF cleaning is usually conducted before alkaline chemistry brush scrubbing. For advanced nodes, to achieve reduction of Si3N4 loss and minimization of feature topography, slurries with high removal rate selectivity (SiO2 vs. Si3N4) are needed. Therefore, slurries containing CeO2 particles are the preferred oxide CMP slurries [5]. Neither brush scrubbing nor megasonic cleaning with dilute NH4OH or SC-1 can effectively remove CeO2 particles.  HF cleaning in a brush box provides limited capability with respect to removing CeO2 particles, which is achieved by stripping a thin CeO2contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Wafer buffing with water or chemical on a polisher platen or a separate platen is required for more effective CeO2 particle removal.  For high-k metal gate fabrication, the dummy gate-open CMP step includes polishing the SiO2 film with highly selective slurries to stop on the Si3N4 surface [28]. This is followed by polishing of the oxide, nitride, and polySi films with a nonselective slurry to stop on polySi. For this process, the postCMP cleaning step must remove particles and residues from the\n",

Collert et al. [157] found that atomic O does not play a significant role in the stripping of photoresist when using an RF discharge at low pressures (75 mTorr) and low flows (10 sccm) of O2.  For bothMWand RF downstream systems, ionized species directly contact the wafer surface during the process. Therefore, the ionized species of the plasma provides a background of constant light emission. However, for ICP plasma systems that use a double grid with offset holes, most ofthe ionized species will not reach the wafer surface so the wafer is exposed to extremely low or no background light emissions. In this case, only neutral species reach the wafer surface to react with photoresist. In other cases, once the photoresist is consumed by the active neutral species, the light is extinguished for most of the visual wavelength.  The wavelength of the light used to detect the endpoint is dependent on the reaction chemistry. Some of the reactive gases used in plasma stripping are very dilute and thus make detection of the byproduct or the reaction gas species very difficult. Also, downstream plasmas sometimes have few molecules in excited states, especially near the wafer surface, resulting in detection limitations. The light may be monitored in the reaction chamber or downstream. Build-up of impurities in the reaction chamber may influence the endpoint.

      "QUESTION: Can we leverage ion-neutral synergy to enhance the oxidizing power of O2/H2 radicals on the tungsten sidewall?\n",
      "\n",
      "ANSWER: Yes, ion-neutral synergy can be leveraged to enhance the oxidizing power of O2/H2 radicals on the tungsten sidewall. Ion-neutral synergy refers to the interaction between ions and neutral species in a plasma, which can lead to enhanced chemical reactions and etching rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of O2/H2 radicals, the presence of ions such as O+ and H+ can enhance the oxidizing power of the radicals by increasing their reactivity with the tungsten surface. This is because the ions can help to break down the tungsten oxide layer, allowing the radicals to penetrate deeper into the material and react more efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the use of ion-neutral synergy can also help to reduce the amount of damage caused by the etching process. By carefully controlling the ratio of ions to neutrals in the plasma, it is possible to minimize the amount of ion-induced damage while still achieving high etching rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, leveraging ion-neutral synergy can be an effective way to enhance the oxidizing power of O2/H2 radicals on the tungsten sidewall, and can help to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the etching process.\n",

Plasma stripping and cleaning. Reactions involved in the removal of bulk photoresist with plasma-generated atomic O were described [221,222], including the use of downstream reactors to minimize ion-induced surface damage [223]. Water vapor addition can be beneficial [225,226] and so is the use of 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 in creating a nonoxidizing environment [201].  The removal of complex etching residues from deep Si trenches [227] using reactive chemical species in a downstream microwave discharge was reported [228]. Metal etch residues with corrosive Cl impurities [222] require the use of in situ H2O-based downstream plasmas followed by wet-chemical cleaning [229]. Removal of etch residues by plasma treatments has been the subject of intensive studies to formulate effective processes. Predeposition cleaning and surface conditioning before gate dielectric formation under optimal conditions and plasma-assisted cleaning before epitaxy are additional critical operations that require carefully optimized procedures [231].  Cryogenic aerosol cleaning and conditioning. This emerging technology has received extensive attention during this period, as evident from the considerable amount of published papers. A theoretical analysis of cryogenic aerosol wafer cleaning has been reported [232]. Nondamaging cryogenic Ar/ N2 aerosols for cleaning IC device wafers with fragile interconnect structures have been used [233,234], including postpatterned BEOL cleaning of wafers with Cu metallization and low-k dielectrics [235]. Cryogenic aerosol processors for the fab are now available [233,234]. SCO2 cleaning has been demonstrated to remove submicron particles and residues from post-CMP treated surfaces more effectively than is resulting from other cleaning processes [240,241]. Organic impurities appear to be removable by a liquid CO2 phase [236e239]. Refined SCO2\n",

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: effect of bromine is based on the fact that CBr4 is not very volatile - it has a boiling point of 190 ∘C. Bromine can also combine with the silicon, which is sputtered from the hardmask, and oxygen to form silicon oxybromides. The passivating effect of sulfur is thought to be caused by the ability of sulfur to form polymers with carbon. The passivation is deposited from the plasma.  In the case of a polysilicon mandrel, typical RIE processes are halogen based. If chlorine or hydrogen bromide gases are used, selectivity to the mask is achieved via plasma deposition of silicon oxychloride and oxybromide reaction products. These compounds also deliver sidewall passivation. For fluorine-based plasma chemistry, fluorocarbon polymer gases are added to provide mask and sidewall passivation by carbon compounds.  The mandrel profiles must be absolutely vertical and without bottom foot. Otherwise, the spacer profiled will be asymmetric and in extreme cases the spacer can topple. Thin yet effective passivation layers such as sulfur or carbon are preferred.  The next step in the SADP flow is spacer deposition, typically by conformal CVD or ALD of SiO2 or Si3N4. TiOx spacers are used in BEOL SADP. Because the outer side of the spacer is formed by deposition, LWR/LER performance is excellent at the outer edge. The inner edge is determined by the mandrel lithography, trim, and etch process. The trim step smoothens the sidewall. Therefore, one of the most outstanding properties of SADP is the excellent high- and medium-frequency LWR/LER performance.  Low-frequency LWR/LER is impacted by potential bending or buckling of the mandrel or the spacer. Both affect the space between the spacers, but not the width of the spacers, which is determined solely by deposition. To leverage this effect, positive and negative spacer schemes have been introduced. The positive tone spacer scheme is used to pattern structures where the width of the line is the critical dimension. Examples are logic\n",

The removal of bulk photoresist patterns is typically accomplished by reaction with atomic oxygen (O), which is created in the plasma environment by dissociation of molecular O2 [221,222]. Basically, two types of plasma reactors can be used to conduct the process both designed for single-wafer processing.  1. A design based on remote or downstream plasma generation 2. A design based on the combination of remote with RF, microwave, or ECR sources for downstream plasma generation with RF-assisted bias.  The preferred method of bulk photoresist stripping after plasma pattern etching or ion implantation now uses downstream reactors, which minimizes ion-induced surface damage while providing good control over reaction parameters with O2 [223]. The stripping rate can often be increased by adding specific gases or vapors to the O2 plasma such as F-containing gases [224], or H2O vapor, which provides additional benefits [225]. Device structures, which cannot withstand oxidation require a nonoxidizing environment. A mixture of typically 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 can then be used as the reactive gas in the plasma cleaning procedure [201].  Patterned photoresist is often used as a mask for the selective implantation of ions. During this process, the surface of the photoresist becomes hardened, making it difficult to remove the used resist layer. Low-energy treatment in an O2 plasma containing an optimally controlled quantity of H2O vapor can remove the resist without damage to the substrate [226].  ## 1.4.6.3.3 Removal Of Etch Residues  Plasma etching used for generating higheaspect ratio Si trenches requires the formation of an etching-resistant sidewall passivation layer to provide protection from lateral etching [227].

      "ANSWER: The addition of O2 to the plasma environment can increase the etching rate by providing a source of atomic oxygen (O) that can react with the tungsten surface. However, the optimal concentration of O2 is dependent on various factors such as the type of substrate, the desired etch rate, and the level of damage tolerance.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to [1], the stripping rate of bulk photoresist can be increased by adding specific gases or vapors to the O2 plasma, such as F-containing gases or H2O vapor. However, it is also important to note that high concentrations of O2 can lead to oxidation and damage to certain device structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "To optimize the concentration of O2 for maximum oxidizing power, it is necessary to consider the specific requirements of the etching process and the properties of the substrate material. For example, a mixture of 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 can be used as the reactive gas in the plasma cleaning procedure to provide a nonoxidizing environment [1].\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: the potential is dependent on temperature; thus a small temperature change, such as 1C, can have an effect, typically 2%, on the electrode potential [53]. Thus, for semiconductor applications, where processing temperatures can deviate from the standard 25C, a compensation factor must be included to obtain the correct value for the concentration. Furthermore, the pH, resistivity, and conductivity of an aqueous solution change with temperature, because of the effect of temperature on the dissociation of weak acids and bases and the dissociation of water [54]. Light has studied the effects of temperature on water resistivity, from 0 to 100C [55]. Ionic strength, dissolved CO2, and interference from other ions in the solution will affect the measured value. These phenomena can explain discrepancies with in-line pH, resistivity, and conductivity measurements.  State-of the-art electrodes incorporate temperature compensation algorithms into the electrode's control software, with the realization that if the composition of the process changes, the temperature compensation coefficient must also change.  ## 11.4.3.2 Calibration Of Electrode Measurements  Calibration of electrodes, whether conductivity, resistivity, or pH, must be performed regularly.  Calibration of conductivity electrodes is performed to determine the effective cell constant. The cell constant, Kcell, is dependent on the length between the two electrodes, l, and the surface area of the electrodes, A, which is assumed to be identical for each of the electrodes and is dependent on the electrode material's surface roughness:  $$K_{c e l l}\\;=\\;\\frac{l}{A}$$ $$(11.4\\text{-}14)$$.  Kcell ¼ lA (11.4-14) The conductance value of a solution depends on that ion's mobility [56].  The mobility, m, is dependent on the absolute value of the change of the ion, zi:  $$\\mu\\;=\\;\\frac{z_{i}e}{6\\pi\\eta R_{i}}$$  $$(11.4\\text{-}15)$$  where e is the electron charge, h is the viscosity of the solvent, and Ri is the ion's\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: HF in a SiO2 etching bath [73]. To obtain a constant etch rate, the influence of the by-products of the etching process must be taken into consideration. The researchers assumed that they would observe a decrease in conductivity as the HF is consumed but, in fact, observed an increase in conductivity due to the by-products. The concentration of the HF is controlled by the periodic spiking of HF and the replenishing of H2O into the bath, as determined by an algorithm that uses conductivity as the control parameter. Another contribution to the variation in conductivity is the temperature; the authors found that by holding the temperature constant and maintaining the conductivity of the HF solution, the etch rate of SiO2 can be controlled.  ## 11.5 Future Of In-Line Chemical Monitoring  Wet chemistries are becoming more and more dilute over time. In the past, an SC-1 monitoring system could deal with >3 wt% H2O2, and accuracies of >0.1 wt% would suffice. The trend today is toward solutions with the H2O2 concentrations in the range of a few tenths of a percent, and accuracies need to be in the hundredths of a percent. Monitoring these dilute solutions requires sensors to be both very sensitive and highly stable over time. Current efforts center on new designs of light sources and improved light reference measurements.  An instrument's intrinsic long-term stability can be improved by using zero-point calibration to compensate for long-term drift. This type of calibration requires the test solution to be replaced with a material with known spectroscopic properties. This is usually DIW, although in principle other reference solutions or solids can be used.  There are basic limitations to NIR measurements and optical methods in general, and alternate methods may have to be developed to deal with extremely dilute chemistries. In addition, new chemistries are needed as semiconductor processes advance to smaller and smaller nodes. Measurement methods need to be developed for\n",

The modified precooling delivers a cryogenically cooled gas opposed to a gaseliquid mixture into a modified dispense nozzle, which results in a smaller (nanometer vs. micrometer) and faster (hundreds of meters per second vs. tens of meters per second) aerosol [29,30]. Data regarding PRE and damage-free processing using this modified aerosol is discussed in Section 8.2-7.  ## 8.2.5 Particle Removal Mechanism In Cryogenic Aerosol Cleaning  This section describes the removal mechanism of inhomogeneous contaminants, such as particles, by momentum transfer using cryogenic aerosols. As discussed in Section 8.2, when a mixture of cryogenically cooled gas and liquid is used to generate the cryogenic aerosol, this results in frozen solid particles entrained in a gas stream. The aerosol coming out of a nozzle is directed at the particles on the wafer surface as shown in the schematic in Fig. 8.2-5. The frozen or cryogenic aerosol particles collide with the contaminant particle thereby imparting force to it, and thus momentum transfer. If the force imparted onto the particle is greater than the force of adhesion, the contaminant particle on the wafer surface is dislodged. The gaseous component of the aerosol then drags the particle away from the wafer  ![486_image_0.png](486_image_0.png)  surface. A purge gas, such as N2, flowing parallel to the wafer surface, is used as a curtain to keep the particle from redepositing onto the wafer surface from which it is removed.  The flow of purge gas and the gaseous component of the aerosol stream over the Si wafer surface creates a boundary layer, as described in Chapter 3. The solid cryogenic particles entrained in the gas stream must cross into this boundary layer to arrive at the surface and subsequently remove the contaminant particles [14,19,27,31]. During their flight through the boundary layer,\n",

Removal of sputtered species out of high aspect ratio features is therefore a challenge.  Etching by sputtering without chemical assistance will lead to severe redeposition. This is one of the reasons why IBE is not the technology of choice for etching of semiconductor devices. In RIE and directional ALE, reactive species are introduced, which modify the surface and form halogenated or otherwise fully or partially oxidized molecules. For instance, sputtering of chlorinated silicon surfaces will result in SiCl, SiCl2, SiCl3, and SiCl4 species (Gou et al. 2010). These species have an ion energy of a few electron volts and a near cosine angular distribution. When they collide with sidewall surfaces, they will stick with a probability that is inversely correlated to the number of chlorine atoms in the sputtered molecules (Kiehlbauch and Graves 2003). Therefore, sufficient chlorination of the etching front is important to control sidewall redeposition. Another approach is to use halogen radicals, for instance Cl* or F*, to etch redeposited materials isotropically. Adding radicals to remove redeposited material is however not an option for directional ALE because it would introduce a process step that is not self-limited (see Section 6.2).  ## 2.9 Classification Of Etching Technologies  The naming and classification of an increasing number of etching technologies that are being proposed and already used for patterning of semiconductor devices is sometimes confusing. This situation is becoming exaggerated by the emergence of various ALE implementations. A logical approach to classify all etching technologies is therefore needed.  All etching technologies for semiconductor devices, with the exception of nonreactive IBE, have a chemical component to weaken the top surface and require energy to remove surface atoms. Based on these common characteristics, it\n",

      "\n",
      "**Introduction**\n",
      "\n",
      "The increasing demand for high-performance electronic devices has led to the development of advanced etching techniques, such as atomic layer etching (ALE). In this report, we investigate the factors that influence the oxidizing power of O2/H2 radicals on tungsten sidewall W (width of 15 nm and depth of 75 nm) in high aspect ratio.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sub-Questions and Answers**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **What is the optimal ALE window for tungsten etching with O2/H2 radicals?**\n",
      "\n",
      "The optimal ALE window for tungsten etching with O2/H2 radicals is not explicitly discussed in the provided information. Further research and experimentation are necessary to determine the specific conditions under which the O2/H2 radicals can effectively etch the tungsten sidewall while minimizing damage to the surrounding material.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **How does the binding energy of tungsten influence the sputtering yield and etching rate in this process?**\n",
      "\n",
      "The binding energy of tungsten influences the sputtering yield and etching rate by affecting the ease with which atoms can be removed from the surface. A lower binding energy means that less energy is required to remove an atom, resulting in a higher sputtering yield and etching rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Can we leverage ion-neutral synergy to enhance the oxidizing power of O2/H2 radicals on the tungsten sidewall?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, ion-neutral synergy can be leveraged to enhance the oxidizing power of O2/H2 radicals on the tungsten sidewall. The presence of ions such as O+ and H+ can increase the reactivity of the radicals with the tungsten surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **What is the effect of adding O2 on the etching rate, and how can we optimize its concentration for maximum oxidizing power?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding O2 to the plasma environment can increase the etching rate by providing a source of atomic oxygen (O) that can react with the tungsten surface. However, the optimal concentration of O2 is dependent on various factors such as the type of substrate and desired etch rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **How does the linear DG parameter relate to the gas phase transport coefficient of oxidation rate, and can it be used to predict the optimal conditions for this process?**\n",
      "\n",
      "The linear DG parameter is related to the gas phase transport coefficient of oxidation rate through its effect on diffusion rates. However, more information is needed to predict optimal conditions for this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, increasing the oxidizing power of O2/H2 radicals on tungsten sidewall W (width of 15 nm and depth of 75 nm) in high aspect ratio requires careful consideration of several factors, including the binding energy of tungsten, ion-neutral synergy, and the concentration of O2. While some information is available on these topics, further research and experimentation are necessary to determine the optimal conditions for this process.\n",

These contact holes are patterned in descending order from 650 nm, and a group of these holes is arranged in the order of 20 in the coupon wafer. One group of these holes is defined as set 1, and there are 20 of these sets alternating at intervals of 1.3 mm and 2.3 mm from the wafer edge. Figure 1c shows the position of each wafer by height when the height of the wafer to be etched is adjusted by using bare SiO2. The wafers are equally placed 30 mm from the center of the electrode and positioned to increase in height at 6-mm intervals counterclockwise from the 12 o'clock position.  Figure 1. (a) A schematic of the experiment setup, (b) schematic showing the properties of a wafer, and (c) the top view of the powered electrode. The characteristics of etch profiles, such as the tilt of sidewall, were observed by cutting the etched coupon wafers into cross-sections by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN, Czechia). To quantitatively analyze these characteristics, each area of the etched contact hole was defined as sidewall and etch front. The right and left angles were defined as θR and θL, which indicates the tilt relative to the normal vector of the etch front as depicted in Figure 2. With respect to the normal vector, counterclockwise and clockwise are defined as negative and positive, respectively. There are two examples in Figure 2; the first is the definition of each angle when the tapered portion is etched, and the second is when it is angled. The etching was performed for 10 min at the CCP power of 300 W, Ar flow rate of 65 sccm, C4F8 flow rate of 5 sccm, and pressure of 30 mTorr.  ![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)  ## 3.

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Future of plasma etching for microelectronics Challenges Source text: BEOL must deliver on three key metrics, which are typically in competition with each other: yield, reliability, and minimizing the resistance and capacitance (RC) delays. For conventional Cu interconnects, a bilayer liner is deposited onto the etched feature first.  The materials and thicknesses of the liner stack are chosen to obtain an excellent Cu diffusion barrier and adhesion between Cu and the interlayer dielectric (ILD).36 Figure 10(a) shows a sketch of an etched trench into the ILD with a TaN/Co liner bilayer. TaN is typically deposited using physical vapor deposition (PVD) and inherently has a bread loaf shape near the feature opening resulting in a thinner film in those areas that have reduced line of sight to the ionized species. The Co film has high conformality since it is deposited by CVD. The bilayer liner is then followed, all in situ, by a PVD Cu seed film, which also has bread loafs near the opening.  Even with an ideal profile as sketched in Fig. 10(a), it can be challenging for tight pitch configurations to find a process window where the liner and seed films are thick enough on the feature sidewalls while still leaving enough of an opening at the top of the feature to plate through. Figure 10(b) shows a high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image of a 48 nm pitch interconnect where small voids are visible near the sidewalls. The prewet step during Cu plating is designed to first remove the native Cu oxide and will galvanically attack the underlying Co if the original Cu seed is too thin on the sidewall. These Cu voids then result in a fast Cu electromigration path and significantly reduce the interconnect lifetime. It is, therefore, paramount to optimize the plasma etching and produce a feature that is friendly for the PVD processes that follow.  The etched profile gets more complicated in Fig. 11(a), which shows a dual damascene V1/M2 profile landing on M1. The etch stop and hardmask are each depicted\n",

      "QUESTION: What is the optimal source power to achieve high anisotropy while minimizing bowing?\n",
      "\n",
      "ANSWER: The optimal source power for achieving high anisotropy while minimizing bowing can be determined by considering the relationships between source power, ion flux, and etching characteristics. According to the provided information, capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) performs the etching process, and CCP power is set to 300 W [1]. However, this value may not be optimal for all cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine the optimal source power, we need to consider the aspect ratio of the hole (depth-to-width) and the desired etching characteristics. A higher source power can increase ion flux, which can improve anisotropy but also increase bowing [2]. Therefore, a balance between source power and ion energy is necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "A possible approach is to use a lower source power and adjust the ion energy to achieve high anisotropy while minimizing bowing. However, without more specific information about the etching process and desired characteristics, it is difficult to provide a precise value for the optimal source power.\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: However, with the implementation of finFET (fin field effect transistor) architectures since the 22-nm node, these fin structures are extremely sensitive.  In the case of fins, the clean immediately following the dry etch that forms the fin is extremely sensitive to damage, because of its thin width and high aspect ratio. Etch residues must be removed without physical damage and the closely spaced features dried without stiction-related collapse. In the case of gate feature patterns, photoresist striping is especially sensitive because of the potential loss of material. After ion implantation with a photoresist mask, a sequence of plasma stripeSPMeSC-1 is typically used to remove the photoresist. This combination leads to: 1. Consumption of Si because of the combination of oxidation and etching.  2. Potential damage to narrow (<2 nm) polySi gate lines from the physical energy used for particle removal.  Silicon consumption, historically, was not a problem, but the number of implantation steps after gate formation has increased as the doping profiles have become shallower; therefore, more Si undesirably is consumed. Of course, SC-1 can be processed at reduced concentration, temperature, and/or time to minimize the consumption, but this can compromise PRE, which also is affected by reducing or eliminating the use of megasonic processing because of pattern damage. Optimization and the development of nondamaging cleaning with megasonic energy or jet spray are being carried out by various research groups.  Logic FEOL integration schemes have demonstrated the use of Ge as a channel material for PMOS (p-channel MOS), because of its high carrier mobility [161]. Currently, SiGe is in production use, with the content of Ge in these films expected to increase until the ultimate limit of pure Ge. Meanwhile, III-V materials have been proposed to realize electron mobility improvement in NMOS (n-channel MOS) [162]. These new materials represent a fundamental shift from the\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Future of plasma etching for microelectronics Challenges Source text: BEOL must deliver on three key metrics, which are typically in competition with each other: yield, reliability, and minimizing the resistance and capacitance (RC) delays. For conventional Cu interconnects, a bilayer liner is deposited onto the etched feature first.  The materials and thicknesses of the liner stack are chosen to obtain an excellent Cu diffusion barrier and adhesion between Cu and the interlayer dielectric (ILD).36 Figure 10(a) shows a sketch of an etched trench into the ILD with a TaN/Co liner bilayer. TaN is typically deposited using physical vapor deposition (PVD) and inherently has a bread loaf shape near the feature opening resulting in a thinner film in those areas that have reduced line of sight to the ionized species. The Co film has high conformality since it is deposited by CVD. The bilayer liner is then followed, all in situ, by a PVD Cu seed film, which also has bread loafs near the opening.  Even with an ideal profile as sketched in Fig. 10(a), it can be challenging for tight pitch configurations to find a process window where the liner and seed films are thick enough on the feature sidewalls while still leaving enough of an opening at the top of the feature to plate through. Figure 10(b) shows a high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image of a 48 nm pitch interconnect where small voids are visible near the sidewalls. The prewet step during Cu plating is designed to first remove the native Cu oxide and will galvanically attack the underlying Co if the original Cu seed is too thin on the sidewall. These Cu voids then result in a fast Cu electromigration path and significantly reduce the interconnect lifetime. It is, therefore, paramount to optimize the plasma etching and produce a feature that is friendly for the PVD processes that follow.  The etched profile gets more complicated in Fig. 11(a), which shows a dual damascene V1/M2 profile landing on M1. The etch stop and hardmask are each depicted\n",

In this section, we reviewed the etch innovations introduced to pattern leading edge logic and memory technologies. In logic, we continue to march further down the path of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor scaling and ultimately toward beyond CMOS concepts. The industry is already exploring smaller scaling by stacking n-MOS and p-MOS gate-all-around devices in a selfaligned patterning approach.6 Also, in order to achieve even lower power operations, beyond CMOS concepts are being explored, such as negative capacitance FETs, tunnel FETs and spin-FETs, bringing new types of materials (e.g., 2D materials, multicomponent alloys, superlattices), and architectures for etching.6 Therefore, it is essential to understand processes at the atomic level to achieve the level of precision currently required and this can only be realized by continued close collaboration between industry and academia.  ## B. Direct Print Euv Pattern Transfer Using Plasma Etch For Tight Pitch Metal Layers Hiten Kothari, Steven G. Jaloviar  The adoption of EUV lithography has been introducing new challenges for pattern transfer by plasma etching. We describe the pattern transfer for direct print EUV layers using plasma dry etch for tight pitch metal layers. Careful co-optimization of the lithographic process, film stack, and etch processes is necessary to deliver a defect-free process window for high-volume manufacturing (HVM).

To mitigate magnetically induced drifts, industrial MERIE tools were designed with oscillatory magnetic fields, such as rotating magnets on Tokyo Electron's Dynamic Resource Management (TEL DRM) chamber.198 In the past decade or so, MERIE has faded away, mostly because the shrink of CD renders μm/min ER unnecessary. However, an external magnetic field brings one more degree of freedom into controlling the plasma, and this concept could be \"recycled\" and reapplied for uniformity and profile control in future applications.  The challenges in industrial plasma etch originate from scaling (see Fig. 24). First, for X-Y (planar) scaling, plasma-based patterning development is dominated by the adoption of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and overlays.199 It has been reported there is a triangular trade-off relationship among resolution, exposure dose, and defect control in EUV lithography.200 One of the three must be sacrificed if the other two are defined. Due to the optical constraint of EUV lithography and low dose requirement for throughput, plasma etch is asked to mitigate defects originating from EUV patterning, such as LER and stochastics-printing errors (scum, breakage).201,202 Promising technology includes resist hardening by energetic or reactive species from plasma,203 printing error repair by plasma-based deposition-trimming cycles,204 and direct scum removal using energetic species.201 Furthermore, the recent progress on metal compound EUV photoresists,205 with their promising improvement on sensitivity and resolution, also demands for innovative plasma etch processes.206 Second, for Z (vertical) scaling, the arrival of 3D device architectures\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: supply of fluorine across the fluorocarbon film to the interface and out-diffusion of the etching product (Oehrlein and Lee 1987).  Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Future of plasma etching for microelectronics Challenges Source text: BEOL must deliver on three key metrics, which are typically in competition with each other: yield, reliability, and minimizing the resistance and capacitance (RC) delays. For conventional Cu interconnects, a bilayer liner is deposited onto the etched feature first.  The materials and thicknesses of the liner stack are chosen to obtain an excellent Cu diffusion barrier and adhesion between Cu and the interlayer dielectric (ILD).36 Figure 10(a) shows a sketch of an etched trench into the ILD with a TaN/Co liner bilayer. TaN is typically deposited using physical vapor deposition (PVD) and inherently has a bread loaf shape near the feature opening resulting in a thinner film in those areas that have reduced line of sight to the ionized species. The Co film has high conformality since it is deposited by CVD. The bilayer liner is then followed, all in situ, by a PVD Cu seed film, which also has bread loafs near the opening.  Even with an ideal profile as sketched in Fig. 10(a), it can be challenging for tight pitch configurations to find a process window where the liner and seed films are thick enough on the feature sidewalls while still leaving enough of an opening at the top of the feature to plate through. Figure 10(b) shows a high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image of a 48 nm pitch interconnect where small voids are visible near the sidewalls. The prewet step during Cu plating is designed to first remove the native Cu oxide and will galvanically attack the underlying Co if the original Cu seed is too thin on the sidewall. These Cu voids then result in a fast Cu electromigration path and significantly reduce the interconnect lifetime. It is, therefore, paramount to optimize the plasma etching and produce a feature that is friendly for the PVD processes that follow.  The etched profile gets more complicated in Fig. 11(a), which shows a dual damascene V1/M2 profile landing on M1. The etch stop and hardmask are each depicted\n",

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

In this section, we reviewed the etch innovations introduced to pattern leading edge logic and memory technologies. In logic, we continue to march further down the path of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor scaling and ultimately toward beyond CMOS concepts. The industry is already exploring smaller scaling by stacking n-MOS and p-MOS gate-all-around devices in a selfaligned patterning approach.6 Also, in order to achieve even lower power operations, beyond CMOS concepts are being explored, such as negative capacitance FETs, tunnel FETs and spin-FETs, bringing new types of materials (e.g., 2D materials, multicomponent alloys, superlattices), and architectures for etching.6 Therefore, it is essential to understand processes at the atomic level to achieve the level of precision currently required and this can only be realized by continued close collaboration between industry and academia.  ## B. Direct Print Euv Pattern Transfer Using Plasma Etch For Tight Pitch Metal Layers Hiten Kothari, Steven G. Jaloviar  The adoption of EUV lithography has been introducing new challenges for pattern transfer by plasma etching. We describe the pattern transfer for direct print EUV layers using plasma dry etch for tight pitch metal layers. Careful co-optimization of the lithographic process, film stack, and etch processes is necessary to deliver a defect-free process window for high-volume manufacturing (HVM).

Plasma stripping and cleaning. Reactions involved in the removal of bulk photoresist with plasma-generated atomic O were described [221,222], including the use of downstream reactors to minimize ion-induced surface damage [223]. Water vapor addition can be beneficial [225,226] and so is the use of 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 in creating a nonoxidizing environment [201].  The removal of complex etching residues from deep Si trenches [227] using reactive chemical species in a downstream microwave discharge was reported [228]. Metal etch residues with corrosive Cl impurities [222] require the use of in situ H2O-based downstream plasmas followed by wet-chemical cleaning [229]. Removal of etch residues by plasma treatments has been the subject of intensive studies to formulate effective processes. Predeposition cleaning and surface conditioning before gate dielectric formation under optimal conditions and plasma-assisted cleaning before epitaxy are additional critical operations that require carefully optimized procedures [231].  Cryogenic aerosol cleaning and conditioning. This emerging technology has received extensive attention during this period, as evident from the considerable amount of published papers. A theoretical analysis of cryogenic aerosol wafer cleaning has been reported [232]. Nondamaging cryogenic Ar/ N2 aerosols for cleaning IC device wafers with fragile interconnect structures have been used [233,234], including postpatterned BEOL cleaning of wafers with Cu metallization and low-k dielectrics [235]. Cryogenic aerosol processors for the fab are now available [233,234]. SCO2 cleaning has been demonstrated to remove submicron particles and residues from post-CMP treated surfaces more effectively than is resulting from other cleaning processes [240,241]. Organic impurities appear to be removable by a liquid CO2 phase [236e239]. Refined SCO2\n",

Adding megasonic cleaning before brush scrubbing for removing small particles and reducing brush particle loading (significant particle contamination within the brush material) improves the overall particle performance [27]. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), as a result of its SiO2 etching capability, is used to reduce metallic contaminants, by stripping a thin, metal-contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Ideally, HF cleaning is performed after the particle removal with alkaline chemistry in the brush scrubbing step [28]. However, because of brush particle loading in the HF process and the relatively long DIW rinse time required after HF etching processing, HF cleaning is usually conducted before alkaline chemistry brush scrubbing. For advanced nodes, to achieve reduction of Si3N4 loss and minimization of feature topography, slurries with high removal rate selectivity (SiO2 vs. Si3N4) are needed. Therefore, slurries containing CeO2 particles are the preferred oxide CMP slurries [5]. Neither brush scrubbing nor megasonic cleaning with dilute NH4OH or SC-1 can effectively remove CeO2 particles.  HF cleaning in a brush box provides limited capability with respect to removing CeO2 particles, which is achieved by stripping a thin CeO2contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Wafer buffing with water or chemical on a polisher platen or a separate platen is required for more effective CeO2 particle removal.  For high-k metal gate fabrication, the dummy gate-open CMP step includes polishing the SiO2 film with highly selective slurries to stop on the Si3N4 surface [28]. This is followed by polishing of the oxide, nitride, and polySi films with a nonselective slurry to stop on polySi. For this process, the postCMP cleaning step must remove particles and residues from the\n",

      "ANSWER: Atomic Layer Etching (ALE) plays a crucial role in reducing bowing by providing precise control over the etching process. According to the provided information, ALE allows for the precise control of etching rate [1]. This is particularly important for high-aspect-ratio structures, where bowing can be a significant issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "To optimize ALE parameters for this specific application, we need to consider the relationships between etch chemistry, environment, and plasma conditions. For example, using a combination of optimal etch chemistry (including catalyst gas) and environment (wafer temperature, radical density, ion energy/density) rather than applying more bias power can help mitigate bowing [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, ALE parameters such as the number of cycles, etching time per cycle, and plasma conditions can be optimized to achieve the desired etch profile. For instance, increasing the number of cycles or etching time per cycle can lead to a more precise control over the etching process, but may also increase the risk of bowing [3].\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Future of plasma etching for microelectronics Challenges Source text: intermediate layer. Desorption of etching reaction products is thought to occur through the SiOF and fluorocarbon layers. However, as the oxygen content becomes higher, the thickness of the fluorocarbon film decreases and the etch rate increases as the SiOF layer on SiO2 becomes thicker due to ion impact.  Therefore, the etch rate strongly depends on the thicknesses of both the fluorocarbon and SiOF layers (between Regions I and II). As the oxygen content further increases, direct reaction between the ions and the SiOF layer occurs and the thickness of this layer decreases, causing the etch rate to saturate in Region II. These results quantitatively reveal that the etching properties of SiO2 are strongly related to the presence of SiOF as an intermediate layer.  This provides valuable information for predicting the etching properties of SiO2 and other materials and for further development of HAR etching methods.  Atomic layer etching has attracted attention as a method for forming precise 3D micropatterned structures, and many in situ measurement techniques have already been used to analyze surface reactions.

Polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks. Low-k materials can be fluorine-doped SiO2 or SiOCH-based materials. Selectivity is achieved via polymer deposition on carbon. Applications include contact etching, etching of trenches and via holes for metallization structures, high aspect ratio SiO2 holes for DRAM capacitors, and high aspect ratio holes and trenches in multilayer stacks of SiO2 and Si3N4 or polysilicon for 3D NAND flash memories. This makes RIE with CxFy chemistries one of the most important etching applications in the semiconductor industry.  Another example of deposition-enhanced selectivity is etching of silicon selectively to silicon oxide. A typical application is patterning of polysilicon gates with a few nanometer thin gate oxide stop layer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Moore's Law drove the thickness of gate oxides to less than 50 nm. At that time, the so-called soft-landing steps where introduced. The idea is that the majority of the profile is defined by a chlorine- or fluorine-containing main etch; the soft-landing step clears the majority of the silicon with reasonably vertical profile while an over-etch removes silicon residues and straightens out the bottom profile. A preferred soft-landing contains HBr and oxygen. The etching product in this process is SiOxBy, which is redeposited onto the gate oxide and increases gate oxide selectivity. The latter cannot be precisely measured on blanket silicon and SiO2 wafer because the amount of removed SiO2 is very small and because of loading effects on patterned wafers.  Reflectometry can be used to measure the lifetime as a proxy for gate oxide selectivity in situ as it is exposed and as it breaks through (Lill et al. 2001).

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: etch HfO2 selectively to silicon and silicon oxide, but the bias power must be controlled carefully to achieve selectivity as shown in Figure 7.40. In this experiment, a bias power of only 5 W was needed to achieve an etching rate of 30 Å/min and infinite selectivity to silicon and silicon oxide. The experiments were conducted in a 200 mm ICP reactor at 5 mTorr, a source power of 800 W, and 100 sccm BCl3. To improve the volatility of the etching products such as hafnium chloride, high temperature etching was introduced to gate etching (Helot et al. 2006). In another approach, hafnium oxide is etched at room temperature and the residues are removed in a wet etch process. The exposure to halogen radicals in combination with ion bombardment eases the removal by liquid-phase chemistries.  The mechanism for ion-enhanced chemical etching of hafnium aluminate thin films in Cl2/BCl3 plasmas at room temperature was investigated by Martin et al.  (2009). Several compositions of Hf1− xAlxOy thin films ranging from pure HfO2 to pure Al2O3 were etched in BCl3/Cl2 plasmas and their etch rates were found to scale with √Ei in both Cl2 and BCl3 plasmas. This indicates that the process is a sputtering process. In BCl3 plasma, deposition dominates at ion energies below 50 eV, while etching occurs above that energy with an etch rate three to seven times that in Cl2. This can be explained by the formation of more volatile boron-containing etching products such as (BOCl)3. This reaction pathway facilitates the abstraction of oxygen and etching of metallic aluminum and hafnium by chlorine species (Martin et al. 2009).  Because of etching challenges and limited materials integration flexibility in the \"gate first\" approach, the \"gate last\" integration dominated the industry beyond the 45 nm node. This choice turned out to be the right one to enable the next change in gate integration, the change from planar to FinFET gates (see Figure 7.37). Here, the polysilicon layer for sacrificial\n",

The removal of bulk photoresist patterns is typically accomplished by reaction with atomic oxygen (O), which is created in the plasma environment by dissociation of molecular O2 [221,222]. Basically, two types of plasma reactors can be used to conduct the process both designed for single-wafer processing.  1. A design based on remote or downstream plasma generation 2. A design based on the combination of remote with RF, microwave, or ECR sources for downstream plasma generation with RF-assisted bias.  The preferred method of bulk photoresist stripping after plasma pattern etching or ion implantation now uses downstream reactors, which minimizes ion-induced surface damage while providing good control over reaction parameters with O2 [223]. The stripping rate can often be increased by adding specific gases or vapors to the O2 plasma such as F-containing gases [224], or H2O vapor, which provides additional benefits [225]. Device structures, which cannot withstand oxidation require a nonoxidizing environment. A mixture of typically 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 can then be used as the reactive gas in the plasma cleaning procedure [201].  Patterned photoresist is often used as a mask for the selective implantation of ions. During this process, the surface of the photoresist becomes hardened, making it difficult to remove the used resist layer. Low-energy treatment in an O2 plasma containing an optimally controlled quantity of H2O vapor can remove the resist without damage to the substrate [226].  ## 1.4.6.3.3 Removal Of Etch Residues  Plasma etching used for generating higheaspect ratio Si trenches requires the formation of an etching-resistant sidewall passivation layer to provide protection from lateral etching [227].

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: Atomic Layer Processing semiconductor Source text: electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) fluorocarbon plasma (Joubert et al. 1994). These regimes are a fluorocarbon film deposition regime for small RF bias voltages, a fluorocarbon suppression regime for intermediate bias voltages, and an oxide chemically enhanced sputtering regime for high RF voltages (see Figure 7.11). The experimental results were obtained in an ECR reactor with a microwave power of 1000 W at a pressure of 1 mTorr. These are not typical silicon oxide etching conditions, which operate at medium-density plasmas at pressures above 10 mTorr. The results are nevertheless insightful and important. Bias voltage thresholds for the transition from deposition to etching are 35 V for CHF3 and 60 V for C2F4. The transition from polymer-suppressed regime to chemically enhanced sputtering regime occurs at 55 V for CHF3 and 80 V for C2F4. C2F4 requires higher ion energies to etch because it has a higher polymer deposition rate than CHF3 (Joubert et al. 1994).  The fluorocarbon polymer is not only an etch-inhibiting layer, but also the source of fluorine, which reacts with silicon and carbon, which reacts with oxygen.  Schaepkens et al. found that SiO2, Si3N4, and silicon are covered with a several  ![158_image_0.png](158_image_0.png)  nanometer thin fluorocarbon film during steady-state etching and at sufficiently high bias voltages. A general trend is that the substrate etch rate is inversely proportional to the thickness of the fluorocarbon film (Schaepkens et al. 1999).  Figure 7.12 shows this thickness dependence for SiO2, Si3N4, and silicon. The variable parameters in Figure 7.12 are feed gas chemistry (CHF3, C2F6, C3F6, and C3F6/H2) and operating pressure (6 and 20 mTorr). The RF bias power level corresponds to a self-bias voltage of 100 V. The thickness dependence of the etching rate for all three materials and for all process conditions falls onto one trend curve.

IC manufacturers have replaced physical vapor deposition (PVD) Ta with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) Co (cobalt) liners for advanced nodes [168]. The challenge with Co liner is the galvanic corrosion of the Co that occurs when Cu and Co are in contact with one another, which establishes electrical contact in the cleaning solution [169]. Another widely studied liner candidate is ruthenium (Ru) [170]. When Cu and Ru are in electrical contact in the cleaning solution, it is the Cu that is corroded [171]. Wet cleaning formulation manufactures have put considerable effort into developing cleaning solutions to overcome this issue. In addition to these new liner materials, CVD TiN has been considered as a candidate to replace the PVD TaN barrier layer for the metal 1 contact layer. The challenge, in this case, is to have a cleaning solution that removes the PVD TiN mask (about 300 A˚ ) and still is compatible with CVD TiN barrier.  Reducing the etch stop layer thickness is necessary to realize a lower capacitance for BEOL dual Damascene dielectric layers [172]. Compared with conventional SiCN etch stop layers, AlN (aluminum nitride), AlxOy (aluminum oxide), and other Al compounds are attractive because they exhibit a low etching rate with fluorine-containing gas plasma chemistry because of the predominant formation of AlF3, a low-volatility by-product [173,174]. Some IC manufacturers have replaced SiCN with AlN or AlxOy to improve etch selectivity between the low-k and etch-stop layer. There is a problem when using AlN or AlxOy for etch-stop layers in patterned wafers. During low-k etching, the AlN/AlxOy becomes damaged by exposure to fluorine-containing gas plasma and forms AlF3, which is nonvolatile, but water soluble. This poses a serious formulation challenge for wet cleaning manufacturers, because the AlN is removed when it is dissolved in DIW during the\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: scrubbing either with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) or SC-1 (ammonium hydroxide [NH4OH] and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2] mixture) solution can remove the silica abrasive particles from the oxide surface [26]. Adding megasonic cleaning before brush scrubbing for removing small particles and reducing brush particle loading (significant particle contamination within the brush material) improves the overall particle performance [27]. Hydrofluoric acid (HF), as a result of its SiO2 etching capability, is used to reduce metallic contaminants, by stripping a thin, metal-contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Ideally, HF cleaning is performed after the particle removal with alkaline chemistry in the brush scrubbing step [28]. However, because of brush particle loading in the HF process and the relatively long DIW rinse time required after HF etching processing, HF cleaning is usually conducted before alkaline chemistry brush scrubbing. For advanced nodes, to achieve reduction of Si3N4 loss and minimization of feature topography, slurries with high removal rate selectivity (SiO2 vs. Si3N4) are needed. Therefore, slurries containing CeO2 particles are the preferred oxide CMP slurries [5]. Neither brush scrubbing nor megasonic cleaning with dilute NH4OH or SC-1 can effectively remove CeO2 particles.  HF cleaning in a brush box provides limited capability with respect to removing CeO2 particles, which is achieved by stripping a thin CeO2contaminated SiO2 layer off the wafer surface. Wafer buffing with water or chemical on a polisher platen or a separate platen is required for more effective CeO2 particle removal.  For high-k metal gate fabrication, the dummy gate-open CMP step includes polishing the SiO2 film with highly selective slurries to stop on the Si3N4 surface [28]. This is followed by polishing of the oxide, nitride, and polySi films with a nonselective slurry to stop on polySi. For this process, the postCMP cleaning step must remove particles and residues from the\n",

      "The following information related to your question is from TITLE: handbook-of-silicon-wafer-cleaning-technology-third-edition compress Source text: as an introduction to Chapter 6.  ## 1.4.6.3.2 Stripping Of Bulk Photoresist  Photoresists are essentially hydrocarbon polymers composed of a novolack resin, a photoactive compound and an organic solvent. The removal of bulk photoresist patterns is typically accomplished by reaction with atomic oxygen (O), which is created in the plasma environment by dissociation of molecular O2 [221,222]. Basically, two types of plasma reactors can be used to conduct the process both designed for single-wafer processing.  1. A design based on remote or downstream plasma generation 2. A design based on the combination of remote with RF, microwave, or ECR sources for downstream plasma generation with RF-assisted bias.  The preferred method of bulk photoresist stripping after plasma pattern etching or ion implantation now uses downstream reactors, which minimizes ion-induced surface damage while providing good control over reaction parameters with O2 [223]. The stripping rate can often be increased by adding specific gases or vapors to the O2 plasma such as F-containing gases [224], or H2O vapor, which provides additional benefits [225]. Device structures, which cannot withstand oxidation require a nonoxidizing environment. A mixture of typically 10 vol% H2e90 vol% N2 can then be used as the reactive gas in the plasma cleaning procedure [201].  Patterned photoresist is often used as a mask for the selective implantation of ions. During this process, the surface of the photoresist becomes hardened, making it difficult to remove the used resist layer. Low-energy treatment in an O2 plasma containing an optimally controlled quantity of H2O vapor can remove the resist without damage to the substrate [226].  ## 1.4.6.3.3 Removal Of Etch Residues  Plasma etching used for generating higheaspect ratio Si trenches requires the formation of an etching-resistant sidewall passivation layer to provide protection from lateral etching [227]. Plasma-assisted cleaning is often not adequate to\n",

      "QUESTION: Can fluorocarbon films be used to slow down the etching rate at the bottom of the hole, and if so, how can we control their thickness?\n",
      "\n",
      "ANSWER: Yes, fluorocarbon films can be used to slow down the etching rate at the bottom of the hole. According to the provided information, polymer-enhanced selectivity enables patterning and high aspect ratio etching of SiO2, Si3N4, and low-k materials with carbon-based masks [1]. This means that fluorocarbon films can be used to control the etching rate by depositing a thin layer on the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "To control the thickness of the fluorocarbon film, various techniques can be employed. For example, Schaepkens et al. found that the substrate etch rate is inversely proportional to the thickness of the fluorocarbon film [2]. This means that by adjusting the process conditions such as RF bias voltage and feed gas chemistry, the thickness of the fluorocarbon film can be controlled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the use of downstream reactors with O2 plasma and H2O vapor can also help control the thickness of the fluorocarbon film [3]. By optimizing the reaction parameters, the stripping rate of the photoresist can be increased while minimizing damage to the substrate.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Introduction**\n",
      "\n",
      "The task is to reduce the SiN etching at the bottom of a hole with a width of 15 nm and a depth of 70 nm without bowing. This requires optimizing various parameters such as source power, aspect ratio, atomic layer etching (ALE), ion energy, and fluorocarbon film thickness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sub-Question 1: Optimal Source Power**\n",
      "\n",
      "The optimal source power for achieving high anisotropy while minimizing bowing can be determined by considering the relationships between source power, ion flux, and etching characteristics. A higher source power can increase ion flux, which can improve anisotropy but also increase bowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sub-Question 2: Aspect Ratio**\n",
      "\n",
      "The high aspect ratio (AR) of 70 nm to 15 nm can significantly impact the etching process. To accommodate this high AR, adjustments can be made to the etch chemistry, environment, and plasma conditions. For example, using a combination of optimal etch chemistry (including catalyst gas) and environment (wafer temperature, radical density, ion energy/density) rather than applying more bias power can help mitigate these challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sub-Question 3: Atomic Layer Etching (ALE)**\n",
      "\n",
      "Atomic Layer Etching (ALE) plays a crucial role in reducing bowing by providing precise control over the etching process. ALE allows for the precise removal of material, and its parameters such as the number of cycles, etching time per cycle, and plasma conditions can be optimized to achieve the desired etch profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sub-Question 4: Ion Energy**\n",
      "\n",
      "Ion energy plays a crucial role in determining the etching rate and anisotropy of a material. Higher ion energies result in higher sputtering processes, which can increase the etching rate but also lead to increased bowing or tapering. The optimal ion energy range for this process depends on various factors such as the material being etched, the desired etch profile, and the specific etching conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sub-Question 5: Fluorocarbon Film Thickness**\n",
      "\n",
      "Fluorocarbon films can be used to slow down the etching rate at the bottom of the hole. The thickness of the fluorocarbon film can be controlled by adjusting process conditions such as RF bias voltage and feed gas chemistry. By optimizing these parameters, the stripping rate of the photoresist can be increased while minimizing damage to the substrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, reducing SiN etching at the bottom of a hole with a width of 15 nm and a depth of 70 nm without bowing requires careful optimization of various parameters such as source power, aspect ratio, atomic layer etching (ALE), ion energy, and fluorocarbon film thickness. By understanding the relationships between these parameters and adjusting them accordingly, it is possible to achieve high anisotropy while minimizing bowing.\n",
